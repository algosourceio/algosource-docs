# Claiming an Issue

Claiming an issue is a **social contract**. You're saying "I'll handle this." Don't take it lightly.

## Why Claiming Matters

        B1 --> C1[Duplicate effort]
        C1 --> D1[One PR rejected]
        D1 --> E1[Wasted time ❌]
    end
```

        B2 --> C2[No duplicates]
        C2 --> D2[Your PR gets reviewed]
        D2 --> E2[Merged! ✅]
    end
```

## When NOT to Claim

### ❌ Don't Claim If:

**1. You don't have time**
```
"I'll do this when I'm free next month"
# Don't - claim when ready to start
```

**2. You don't understand the issue**
```
"I have no idea what this means but I'll figure it out"
# Don't - ask questions first
```

**3. You're already working on multiple issues**
```
"I have 3 other PRs open but I'll add this too"
# Don't - finish what you started
```

**4. You just want credit**
```
"I'll claim this and maybe get to it someday"
# Don't - this blocks others
```

**5. It's way beyond your skill**
```
"I've never used this language but how hard can it be?"
# Don't - you'll likely give up
```
