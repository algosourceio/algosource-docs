# Why PRs Get Ignored

It's not always personal.

## Real Reasons

```
40% - Maintainer is busy
30% - PR is low priority
15% - Unclear what PR does
10% - PR needs work
5% - Other reasons
```

## Signs It's Not You

- PR has 0 comments
- Maintainer hasn't responded to anyone
- Other PRs also waiting
- No recent activity in general

(This is likely a busy maintainer, not rejection)

## Signs You Should Improve

- PR is commented but feedback ignored
- Your PR is still waiting after others merged
- Maintainer asked questions you didn't answer

(This is feedback, not ghosting)

## What to Do

```
Week 1: Nothing (waiting is normal)
Week 2: Gentle ping "Is this ready for review?"
Week 3: Check if project is active at all
Week 4: If still nothing, consider moving on
```

## Prevention

When opening PR:
- Self-review first
- Write clear description
- Link related issue
- Ask for feedback respectfully
