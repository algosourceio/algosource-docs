## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until I can call myself a contributor?

After your first merged PR. Seriously. One contribution makes you a contributor.

### How much time do I really need?

Minimum 5 hours/week when starting. You can reduce this once you're familiar with a project.

### What if my PR gets rejected?

It happens to everyone. Ask for feedback, learn, and try again. It's not personal.

### Should I contribute to popular projects?

Popular projects have more support but more competition. Mid-sized active projects are often better for beginners.

### Do I need to know everything before starting?

No. Learning while contributing is normal. Ask questions when stuck.
