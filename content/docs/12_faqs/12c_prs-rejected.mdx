# Why PRs Get Rejected

Rejection isn't failure. It's feedback.

## Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason | What To Do |
|--------|-----------|
| **Out of scope** | Ask before next PR |
| **Design disagreement** | Open discussion first |
| **Better way exists** | Learn the pattern |
| **Timing** | Ask when to revisit |
| **Maintainer overloaded** | Offer to maintain |

## The Feedback Loop

```
PR rejected
    ↓
Why was it rejected?
    ↓
Understand the reasoning
    ↓
Adjust your approach
    ↓
Next PR is better
```

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Reopen immediately
- ❌ Argue with maintainer
- ❌ Submit identical PR again
- ❌ Give up on the project

## What TO Do

```
Ask: "Can you help me understand?"
Listen: "Here's why we rejected it"
Learn: "Now I understand the pattern"
Try: "How about this approach instead?"
```

> **Each rejection is a gift.** It teaches you what matters to that project.
