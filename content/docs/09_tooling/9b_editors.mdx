# Code Editors & IDE Setup

Your editor is where you spend most time. Make it count.

## Popular Choices

| Editor | Best For | Learning Curve |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **VS Code** | Most things | Easy |
| **JetBrains IDEs** | Professional dev | Medium |
| **Vim/Neovim** | Power users | Hard |
| **Emacs** | Customization fanatics | Hard |

## Essential Extensions (VS Code)

```
Code Quality:
- Pylance (Python)
- ESLint (JavaScript)
- Prettier (Formatting)

Productivity:
- GitLens
- GitHub Copilot
- Thunder Client (REST)

Appearance:
- Dracula (Theme)
- Icons extension
```

## Configuration

Create `.editorconfig`:
```
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[*.py]
indent_size = 4
```

This ensures consistency across editors.

## Debugging Setup

Most editors support debugging:
- Set breakpoints
- Inspect variables
- Step through code

Much better than `print()` debugging!
