# Logs, Stack Traces & Error Reports

Master the error output and you master debugging.

## Stack Traces

Show the path that led to error:

```
File "main.py", line 15, in <module>
    process_user(user_id)
    ↓
File "service.py", line 42, in process_user
    user = get_user(user_id)
    ↓
File "db.py", line 8, in get_user
    return db.query(User).filter(id=user_id).first()
    ↓
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'first'
```

**Read backwards:**
- Last line: The actual error
- Lines above: How you got there

## Log Levels

```
DEBUG:   Detailed info for debugging
INFO:    General information (startup, etc)
WARNING: Something unexpected, not an error
ERROR:   Something failed, but app continues
CRITICAL: App is stopping
```

Use appropriate level for clarity.

## Error Messages

Good error messages have:

```
❌ Bad:
"Error 404"

✅ Good:
"User with ID 123 not found in database. 
 Expected user to exist before processing. 
 Check if user was created successfully."
```

## Reporting Errors

When reporting a bug, include:

1. **Exact error message**
2. **What you did to trigger it**
3. **Expected vs actual behavior**
4. **Stack trace (if available)**
5. **Environment (OS, Python version, etc)**
