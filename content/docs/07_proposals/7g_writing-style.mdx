# Writing Style That Mentors Respect

Your proposal's tone matters as much as content.

## Tone Guidelines

### ❌ Avoid

- Overly formal or stiff
- Arrogant or presumptuous
- Vague or wishy-washy
- Exclamation marks everywhere!!!
- ALL CAPS FOR EMPHASIS

### ✅ Aim For

- Professional yet conversational
- Confident but humble
- Clear and specific
- Respectful of time

## Structure for Readability

```markdown
# Clear Title

## Concise Introduction (2-3 sentences)
Set context briefly.

## Well-Organized Sections
Use headings liberally.

- Use bullet points for lists
- Not paragraph form with commas

### Sub-sections when needed
Break up large topics.

## Conclusion (1 paragraph)
Summarize key points.
```

## Example Comparison

### ❌ Weak Style

```
The project would benefit from a new feature related to caching. 
I think that Redis might be useful for this purpose. I would 
implement this feature if selected and I am pretty confident 
I can do it. The timeline would be approximately a few weeks 
and deliverables would include the new caching system.
```

### ✅ Strong Style

```
## Proposal: Redis Caching Layer

### Problem
Post queries currently hit the database every time, causing 
high load during peak usage.

### Solution
Implement Redis caching with:
- TTL-based expiration (5 minutes default)
- Cache invalidation on post updates
- Fallback to DB for cache misses

### Timeline
Weeks 1-2: Setup and integration tests
Weeks 3-4: Core implementation and unit tests
Week 5: Performance testing and optimization
Week 6: Buffer for reviews and refinement

### Success Metrics
- 70%+ cache hit rate in production
- 50% reduction in average query latency
- Zero data inconsistency issues
```

## Writing Tips

1. **Be Specific**
   - "During X months" not "eventually"
   - "Component Y will do Z" not "things will improve"

2. **Use Active Voice**
   - "I will implement" not "The feature will be implemented"

3. **Show Confidence**
   - "I will" not "I might"
   - But not overconfidence

4. **Proofread**
   - Grammar and spelling matter
   - One typo suggests carelessness

5. **Read Aloud**
   - Does it flow naturally?
   - Would you say it this way?
