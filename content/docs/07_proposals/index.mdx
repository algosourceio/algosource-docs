# Writing a Winning Proposal

For programs like GSoC, Outreachy, and LFX, your proposal is everything.

## Proposal Fundamentals

A winning proposal demonstrates:

1. **Understanding** — You know the project and problem
2. **Competence** — You have the skills to execute
3. **Planning** — You've thought through the approach
4. **Communication** — You can articulate clearly

<Callout type="warning">
Generic proposals fail. Every proposal should be customized for the specific organization and project.
