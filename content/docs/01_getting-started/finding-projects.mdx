<Callout type="info" title="The Right Project Matters">
Your first project can make or break your open source journey. Choose poorly, and you'll struggle. Choose wisely, and you'll thrive.
</Callout>

## The Project Selection Framework

Finding a good first project requires balancing multiple factors:

## Step 1: Start With Your Interests

<div className="bg-neutral-800/50 border border-neutral-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">

### Ask Yourself

- **What tools do you already use?** Contributing to tools you use daily is easier because you understand the user perspective.
- **What languages are you comfortable with?** Your first contribution shouldn't require learning a new language.
- **What domains interest you?** Web dev? DevOps? AI/ML? Data science? Gaming?
- **What do you want to learn?** Use open source as a learning opportunity.

### Interest Categories

## Step 2: Evaluate Project Health

Not all projects are good for contributors. Look for these signals:

### 🟢 Green Flags

<Checklist>
<ChecklistItem>**Recent commits** — Activity in the last month</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Active issue responses** — Maintainers reply to issues</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**PRs getting merged** — Not just opened, but merged</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**CONTRIBUTING.md exists** — Clear contribution guidelines</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Code of Conduct** — Community standards defined</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**"Good first issue" labels** — Newcomers are welcome</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Helpful review comments** — Constructive, not hostile</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

### 🔴 Red Flags

<div className="bg-red-500/10 border border-red-500/30 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">

<ul className="space-y-2">
<li>❌ **No commits in months** — Project may be abandoned</li>
<li>❌ **PRs sitting for months** — Maintainers overwhelmed or MIA</li>
<li>❌ **Hostile issue comments** — Toxic community</li>
<li>❌ **No documentation** — Will be hard to contribute</li>
<li>❌ **Single maintainer, inactive** — Bus factor = 1</li>
<li>❌ **Closed to outside contributions** — Check if PRs from outsiders get merged</li>
</ul>

</div>

### How to Check

```
GitHub Insights (for any repo)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Go to the repository
2. Click "Insights" tab
3. Check:
   - Pulse: Recent activity
   - Contributors: Who's active
   - Commits: Frequency
   - Code frequency: Development pace
4. Look at "Pull Requests" tab
   - How quickly are they merged?
   - Are they reviewed constructively?
```

---

## Step 3: Where to Find Projects

### 1. GitHub Explore

[github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore)

- Trending repositories
- Topics you follow
- Collections by category

### 2. Good First Issues Aggregators

| Site | URL | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Good First Issue | goodfirstissue.dev | Curated by language |
| First Timers Only | firsttimersonly.com | Beginner-focused |
| Up For Grabs | up-for-grabs.net | Projects seeking help |
| CodeTriage | codetriage.com | Get issues in your inbox |
| Ovio | ovio.org | Task-based matching |

### 3. GitHub Search Queries

Use GitHub's search to find contributor-friendly projects:

```
# Good first issues in JavaScript
label:"good first issue" language:javascript is:open

# Help wanted in Python, updated recently
label:"help wanted" language:python is:open pushed:>2024-01-01

# Beginner-friendly TypeScript projects
label:"beginner-friendly" language:typescript is:open

# Documentation issues (great for first-timers)
label:"documentation" is:open is:issue
```

### 4. Your Existing Stack

Look at your `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.:

```bash
# See what you're using in a Node.js project
cat package.json | grep -A 100 dependencies
```

Pick a dependency and check its GitHub repo.

### 5. Hacktoberfest Projects

During October, use the "hacktoberfest" label:

```
label:hacktoberfest is:open is:issue
```

<Warning title="Quality Over Quantity">
Hacktoberfest has a spam problem. Focus on quality contributions, not gaming the system.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Size Matters

Project size affects your experience:

| Size | Characteristics | First-timer Experience |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Small** (< 100 stars) | Few maintainers, quick feedback, less formal | Best for learning, personal attention |
| **Medium** (100-1K stars) | Established processes, moderate review time | Good balance of structure and accessibility |
| **Large** (1K-10K stars) | Formal processes, longer review times | More resources, more competition |
| **Huge** (10K+ stars) | Very formal, slow reviews, high standards | Challenging but prestigious |

<Callout type="tip" title="Start Small">
For your first contribution, target small to medium projects. You'll get faster feedback and more personal guidance.
</Callout>

---

## Step 5: Evaluate the First Issue

Once you find a potential project, look for a specific issue to work on:

### Good First Issues

Look for these labels:
- `good first issue`
- `first-timers-only`
- `beginner-friendly`
- `easy`
- `starter`
- `help wanted`
- `documentation`

### Evaluating an Issue

<Checklist>
<ChecklistItem>**Clear description** — You understand what needs to be done</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Not claimed** — No one else is working on it</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Recent activity** — Issue was updated recently</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Within your skills** — You can do this (with some stretching)</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Maintainer engagement** — Maintainer has commented/responded</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

### Before Claiming an Issue

1. **Read the entire issue thread** — Context matters
2. **Check linked PRs** — Make sure it's not already solved
3. **Understand the scope** — Know what you're signing up for
4. **Comment that you're interested** — Ask any clarifying questions
5. **Wait for assignment** — Don't start until you're confirmed
