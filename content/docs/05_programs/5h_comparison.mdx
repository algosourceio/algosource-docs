## Success Rate Honest Breakdown

```
Program         Raw Acceptance  Success Rate
                Rate            (completion)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
GSoC            15-20%          95%+ (students finish)
LFX             25-30%          90%+ (good support)
Outreachy       8-10%           98%+ (screened carefully)
C4GT            20-25%          92%+ (strong support)
ESoC            18-22%          85%+ (varies by org)
SOB             22-28%          88%+ (security orgs)
```

The numbers mean:
- **Acceptance**: How many get selected
- **Completion**: Of those selected, how many finish

GSoC is HARD to get (15%) but almost everyone who gets in finishes (95%).
Outreachy is easier to get (8%) but people who get in almost always finish (98%).

## Multiple Applications Strategy

```
Best approach: Apply to 2-3 programs

Tier 1 (Apply first):
- Outreachy (if eligible) - 5-10% harder
- C4GT (if in India) - 20-25% acceptance
- LFX (if enterprise-interested) - 25-30%

Tier 2 (Backup):
- GSoC (hardest but most prestigious)
- ESoC (if in Europe)

Timing:
Month 1: Contribute to projects
Month 2: Apply to Tier 1 (usually Feb-Mar)
Month 3: If rejected, apply to Tier 2 (usually Mar-Apr)

Real scenario:
You apply to Outreachy (rejected, happens to 90%).
You already have 2-3 months contributions.
You apply to GSoC (now you're stronger, better chance).
You get accepted to GSoC (happened because you didn't give up).
```

## Coordinator Recommendation

| Your Profile | Best Choice | Second Choice | Why |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| **First time + underrepresented** | Outreachy | LFX | Mentorship + easier entry |
| **First time + male** | LFX | GSoC | Gentler than GSoC |
| **CS student + competitive** | GSoC | LFX | Prestige + challenge |
| **India + want impact** | C4GT | GSoC | Local impact + prestige |
| **Europe-based** | ESoC | Outreachy | Regional + support |
| **Security-focused** | SOB | LFX | Specialized + skills |

---

> **Pro tip**: Apply to multiple programs. You'll get rejected from 1-2. That's normal. The acceptance across all programs together is 60-70%.

## Financial Comparison

For 3 months of work:

| Program | Total Stipend | Monthly Rate | Taxes |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **GSoC** | ~$3,000 | $1,000 | Variable |
| **LFX** | ~$4,500 | $1,500 | Variable |

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- **Time availability**: Can I do 20-40 hours/week?
- **Learning goals**: What tech skills do I want to build?
- **Location**: Where am I based? (affects eligibility)
- **Support needs**: How much mentorship do I need?
- **Impact**: Do I care about real-world impact?
- **Career**: What will help my resume most?

## Smart Strategy

### Tier 1: Apply to 1-2 Flagship Programs
- GSoC (if student and globally visible)
- C4GT (if in India and want impact)
- Outreachy (if underrepresented and want support)

### Tier 2: Apply to 2-3 Backup Programs
- LFX (always year-round)
- ESoC (if in Europe)
- SOB (if security-interested)

### Tier 3: Start Contributing Early
- Apply 6 months before program cycle
- Show consistent effort
- Build relationships with mentors

## Rejection Handling

If rejected from first-choice:
1. Get feedback from mentors
2. Keep contributing to that project
3. Apply to Tier 2 program immediately
4. Try again next cycle

Remember: Even top contributors face rejections.

## Post-Program Path

All programs lead to similar outcomes:

```
Program Completion
       ↓
Continued Contributions
       ↓
Domain Expert
       ↓
Maintainer / Tech Lead
       ↓
Career / Speaking / Startup
```

The program you choose matters less than what you do after it.

> **The Real Truth**: The best program is the one you actually complete and continue with. Pick based on fit, not prestige alone.
