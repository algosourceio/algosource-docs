# Communication & Etiquette

Open source is as much about people as code. Master the art of async communication.

## Core Principles

<CardGrid>
<Card title="Assume Good Intent">
Text lacks tone. Give others the benefit of the doubt.
</Card>

<Card title="Be Concise">
Maintainers are busy. Get to the point.
</Card>

<Card title="Be Patient">
Responses may take days or weeks. That's normal.
</Card>

<Card title="Be Grateful">
Thank people for their time and feedback.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Async Communication

Open source is global and async. This means:

- People are in different timezones
- Responses aren't immediate
- Written clarity is essential
- Context must be explicit

<Callout type="tip">
When asking a question, provide all context upfront. Don't say "it doesn't work" — say what you tried, what happened, and what you expected.
</Callout>

## Asking Good Questions

```markdown
❌ Bad Question:
"It doesn't work. Help?"

✅ Good Question:
"I'm trying to run the dev server on Ubuntu 22.04.
Following the README instructions, I ran `npm run dev`.
I got this error: [paste error]
I expected the server to start on port 3000.
I've tried: [what you tried]
Environment: Node 18.x, npm 9.x"
```

## Handling Feedback

<Warning title="Don't Take It Personally">
Code review is about the code, not about you. Even harsh feedback is an opportunity to learn.
</Warning>

Responses to feedback:
- "Thanks for catching that, I'll fix it"
- "I see your point, but I chose this approach because..."
- "Could you elaborate? I'm not sure I understand"
