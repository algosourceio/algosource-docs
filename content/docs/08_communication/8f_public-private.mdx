# Public vs Private Communication

Not everything belongs in public.

## Use Public Channels When

<Checklist>
<ChecklistItem>**Discussing features** affecting the project</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Reporting bugs** that others need to know</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Asking technical questions** others might benefit from</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Providing feedback** relevant to many</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>**Sharing progress** on project work</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

## Use Private Channels When

- Discussing someone's performance
- Sensitive project decisions
- Private mentorship/guidance
- Personal matters
- Conflicts that need resolution

## The Public-First Default

```
Default: Assume public unless reason for private

Advantages:
✓ Transparent decision-making
✓ Others learn from discussions
✓ Creates accountability
✓ No secret handshakes

Disadvantages:
✗ Less privacy
✗ More visibility for mistakes
✗ Can feel intimidating
```

## Handling Public Mistakes

If you mess up publicly:

```
1. Acknowledge immediately
2. Take responsibility
3. Explain what you'll do differently
4. Move forward

Never:
- Delete evidence
- Blame others
- Get defensive
- Make excuses
```

> **Transparency builds trust.** Assume public unless there's a good reason not to.
