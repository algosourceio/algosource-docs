## The GitHub Workflow

    A[Issue Created] --> B[Discussed]
    B --> C[Assigned]
    C --> D[PR Opened]
    D --> E[Review]
    E --> F{Approved?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Merged]
    F -->|No| H[Iterate]
    H --> E
```

## Issues vs Pull Requests

```mermaid

    subgraph Issues
        I1[Report bugs]
        I2[Request features]
        I3[Ask questions]
        I4[Propose changes]
    end
    
    subgraph PRs
        P1[Submit code]
        P2[Fix bugs]
        P3[Add features]
        P4[Update docs]
    end
    
    I1 --> P2
    I2 --> P3
    I4 --> P1
```

### When to Open an Issue

- You found a bug
- You want a new feature
- You need clarification
- You want to propose a change
- You want to discuss before coding

### When to Open a PR

- You have working code to contribute
- You've fixed a bug
- You've implemented a feature
- You've updated documentation

## The Lifecycle

### Issue Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Open: Issue Created
    Open --> InProgress: Assigned
    Open --> Closed: Won't Fix
    InProgress --> InReview: PR Opened
    InReview --> Closed: PR Merged
    InReview --> InProgress: Changes Requested
```

### PR Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Work in Progress
    Draft --> Open: Ready for Review
    Open --> ChangesRequested: Needs Work
    ChangesRequested --> Open: Updated
    Open --> Approved: Looks Good
    Approved --> Merged: CI Passes
    Open --> Closed: Won't Merge
```

## Quality Matters

```mermaid
pie title "PR Outcomes Based on Quality"
    "High quality - Merged quickly" : 45
    "Medium quality - Merged after iteration" : 30
    "Low quality - Rejected" : 15
    "Abandoned" : 10
```

**75%** of quality PRs get merged!

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Vague issue title | Gets ignored | Be specific |
| No reproduction steps | Can't fix | Always include steps |
| Massive PR | Hard to review | Keep PRs small |
| No tests | May break things | Add tests |
| Ignoring feedback | Gets closed | Respond promptly |

## Success Metrics

Track your progress:

- **Response time** - How fast maintainers respond
- **Merge rate** - % of PRs that get merged
- **Iteration count** - Reviews needed before merge
- **Issue resolution** - % of issues you close

> **Key insight:** Issues and PRs are not just technical artifacts—they're communication tools. Clear, well-structured issues and PRs show respect for maintainers' time.
