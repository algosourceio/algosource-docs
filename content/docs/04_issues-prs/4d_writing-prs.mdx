    "Good commit messages" : 10
    "Documentation" : 5
```

## Keeping PRs Small

### Why Size Matters

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title PR Size vs Review Quality
    x-axis Small --> Large
    y-axis Low Quality Review --> High Quality Review
    quadrant-1 Quick & Thorough
    quadrant-2 Careful but Slow
    quadrant-3 Neglected
    quadrant-4 Superficial
    
    Small Bug Fix: [0.2, 0.9]
    Feature Module: [0.5, 0.6]
    Major Refactor: [0.7, 0.4]
    Complete Rewrite: [0.9, 0.2]
```

### Size Guidelines

| PR Size | Lines Changed | Review Time | Quality |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Tiny | < 50 | Minutes | Excellent |
| Small | 50-200 | Hours | Good |
| Medium | 200-500 | Days | Moderate |
| Large | 500+ | Weeks | Poor |

### How to Keep PRs Small

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Large Feature] --> B[Split by layer]
    A --> C[Split by functionality]
    A --> D[Split by steps]
    
    B --> B1[PR 1: Database changes]
    B --> B2[PR 2: API endpoints]
    B --> B3[PR 3: UI components]
    
    C --> C1[PR 1: Core feature]
    C --> C2[PR 2: Enhancement A]
    C --> C3[PR 3: Enhancement B]
    
    D --> D1[PR 1: Add tests for existing]
    D --> D2[PR 2: Refactor needed parts]
    D --> D3[PR 3: Implement feature]
```

### Stacked PRs

For large features:

```
main
  └── feature/user-auth-base (PR #1)
       └── feature/user-auth-api (PR #2)
            └── feature/user-auth-ui (PR #3)
```

## Commit Structure

### One Logical Change Per Commit

```bash
# ❌ Bad: Everything in one commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"

# ✅ Good: Logical commits
git add src/components/Button.tsx
git commit -m "feat(ui): add Button component"

git add src/components/Button.test.tsx
git commit -m "test(ui): add Button component tests"

git add docs/components.md
git commit -m "docs: add Button documentation"
```

### Clean Up Before PR

```bash
# Squash/fixup messy commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# Choose commits to squash:
# pick abc123 feat: add user auth
# fixup def456 fix typo
# fixup ghi789 fix another typo
# fixup jkl012 oops forgot file
```

### ❌ Too Large

```markdown
PR: "Refactor entire codebase"
Changed files: 150
Lines changed: 10,000+

# This will never get proper review
```

### ❌ Poor Description

```markdown
Title: "Fix"
Description: "Fixed the bug"

# No one knows what this does
```

### ❌ Unrelated Changes

```markdown
PR: "Fix login bug"
Also includes:
- Updated eslint config
- Renamed variables throughout
- Added new feature

# Should be 3 separate PRs
```

### ❌ Broken CI

```markdown
CI Status: ❌ Failing
Requesting: "Please review"

# Fix CI before asking for review
```

## Quick Reference

### PR Title Formula

```
type(scope): imperative description

Examples:
feat(api): add user search endpoint
fix(auth): handle expired tokens gracefully
docs: update API reference
```

### Minimum PR Description

```markdown
