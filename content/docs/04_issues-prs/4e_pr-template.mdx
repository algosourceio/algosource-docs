## Template Breakdown

### Summary Section

```markdown
## Summary

This PR implements automatic session timeout for security compliance.
When a user is inactive for 15 minutes, they are automatically logged out
and redirected to the login page with an explanatory message.
```

**What to include:**
- What the PR does (not how)
- Why it's needed
- Key behavior change

**What NOT to include:**
- Implementation details (that's in the code)
- The entire issue description (link to it)

### Motivation and Context

```markdown
## Motivation and Context

Our security audit identified that users can remain logged in indefinitely,
which is a compliance violation for SOC 2. This PR implements automatic
session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.

Without this change:
- Sessions never expire
- Shared computers pose security risk
- We fail compliance requirements

With this change:
- Sessions auto-expire after 15 min
- Users see clear message explaining logout
- We meet SOC 2 requirement 8.1.4
```

### Changes Made

```markdown
## Changes Made

### Added
- `SessionTimeoutProvider` component to track activity
- `useIdleTimer` hook for detecting inactivity
- Session timeout warning modal (shows at 14 min)
- Automatic logout at 15 min of inactivity

### Changed
- `AuthContext` now includes `lastActivity` timestamp
- Login page shows "session expired" message when applicable

### Removed
- Removed legacy `keepAlive` ping (no longer needed)

### Fixed
- Fixed race condition in logout flow
```

**Use semantic categories:**
- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed
- Security

### Additional Notes

```markdown
## Additional Notes

### Performance Considerations
Timer uses `setInterval` with 1-second resolution. This is intentional
as we need accurate timing for compliance. Battery impact is minimal
as modern browsers throttle intervals in background tabs.

### Migration Notes
Existing sessions will be logged out on first inactivity check after
deployment. Consider notifying users about the new security feature.

### Future Improvements
- Make timeout duration configurable (#300)
- Add "Remember me" option to extend timeout (#301)
```

## Project-Specific Templates

Many projects have their own templates. Always check:

```bash
# Template location
.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
.github/pull_request_template.md

# Multiple templates
.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
├── bug_fix.md
├── feature.md
└── documentation.md
```

### If Project Has Template

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Opening PR] --> B{Template exists?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Fill in ALL sections]
    B -->|No| D[Use comprehensive template]
    C --> E[Don't delete sections]
    E --> F[Mark N/A if not applicable]
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Empty Template

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Describe changes -->

## Related Issue
<!-- Link -->

## Changes
<!-- List -->
```

Fill it in! Don't leave placeholders.

### ❌ Too Brief

```markdown
## Summary
Fixed bug

## Changes
- Fixed it
```

Add detail! What bug? How fixed?

### ❌ Deleted Sections

```markdown
## Summary
Added feature X

<!-- Deleted everything else -->
```

Keep sections, mark N/A if not applicable.

### ❌ Wrong Checklist

```markdown
- [x] All items checked without actually checking
```

Only check what you actually did.

## Quick Reference
