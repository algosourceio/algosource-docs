# Bug Reports vs Feature Requests

Different issues need different approaches. Using the wrong format leads to confusion.

## Quick Comparison

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Your Issue] --> B{What type?}
    B -->|Something broken| C[Bug Report]
    B -->|Want something new| D[Feature Request]
    B -->|Not sure how to use| E[Question/Discussion]
    B -->|Security problem| F[Security Report]
    
    C --> C1[Describe the problem]
    D --> D1[Describe the solution]
    E --> E1[Use Discussions instead]
    F --> F1[Use private disclosure]
```

## When to File What

| Situation | Issue Type |
|-----------|-----------|
| App crashes | Bug Report |
| Feature doesn't work as documented | Bug Report |
| Want new functionality | Feature Request |
| Suggest improvement to existing feature | Feature Request |
| Performance issue | Bug Report or Performance Issue |
| Security vulnerability | Security Report (private) |
| Question about usage | Discussion (not issue) |
| Help with your code | Discussion or Stack Overflow |

## Bug Reports

### Definition

A bug is when the software **doesn't work as intended**.

    A[Current State] --> B[Desired State]
    B --> C{Gap?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Feature Request]
    C -->|No| E[Not Needed]
```

### What Makes a Good Feature Request

| Component | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Title | Clear feature name | ✅ Yes |
| Problem/motivation | Why you need it | ✅ Yes |
| Proposed solution | What you want | ✅ Yes |
| Use cases | Specific examples | ✅ Yes |
| Alternatives | Other options you considered | Recommended |
| Mockups | Visual if UI-related | Optional |
| Implementation ideas | Technical suggestions | Optional |

### Feature Request Template

```markdown
## 💡 Feature Request

### Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve?]

### Proposed Solution
[Describe the feature you want]

### Use Cases
1. **As a [user type]**, I want to [action] so that [benefit]
2. 

### Alternatives Considered
1. [Alternative 1] - Why it doesn't work
2. [Alternative 2] - Why it doesn't work

### Additional Context
[Mockups, examples from other tools, etc.]

### Implementation
[If you have technical ideas]

### Contribution
- [ ] I'm willing to implement this feature
- [ ] I can help test this feature
- [ ] I can help document this feature
```

### Feature Request Example

```markdown
## 💡 Feature Request

### Problem Statement
Currently, users cannot export their data. This makes it difficult to:
- Migrate to other tools
- Create backups
- Analyze data in spreadsheets

### Proposed Solution
Add an "Export" button that downloads user data as CSV or JSON.

### Use Cases
1. **As a power user**, I want to export my transactions to analyze them in Excel
2. **As a business user**, I want to backup my data monthly for compliance
3. **As a developer**, I want to export as JSON to use in my own scripts

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual copy/paste** - Too tedious for large datasets
2. **API access** - Too technical for most users
3. **Third-party tools** - Privacy concerns

### Additional Context
Similar tools offer this feature:
- Competitor A: CSV export
- Competitor B: CSV + JSON + PDF

### Implementation
Possible approach:
1. Add export button to toolbar
2. Modal to select format (CSV/JSON)
3. Generate file on client or server
4. Trigger download

### Contribution
- [x] I'm willing to implement this feature
- [x] I can help test this feature
- [x] I can help document this feature

## Not Issues: Questions & Discussions

### When to Use Discussions

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Your Question] --> B{Is it...}
    B -->|How do I...?| C[Discussion]
    B -->|Why doesn't this work?| D[Discussion or Stack Overflow]
    B -->|Should we...?| E[Discussion]
    B -->|I found a bug| F[Issue]
```

### Questions That Belong in Discussions

- "How do I configure X?"
- "What's the best practice for Y?"
- "Can this library do Z?"
- "Help with my code"
- "General feedback"

### Example: Wrong (Issue) vs Right (Discussion)

```markdown
❌ ISSUE: "How do I use the API?"

✅ DISCUSSION:
## Question: API Authentication Best Practices

I'm trying to integrate your API into my app. The docs show basic auth, 
but I'm wondering:

1. Is there an OAuth option?
2. What's the recommended approach for mobile apps?
3. Any rate limit considerations?

Thanks in advance!
```

## Security Reports

### Never Public!

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Found Security Issue] --> B{Public Issue?}
    B -->|NO!| C[Check SECURITY.md]
    C --> D{Has Policy?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Follow their process]
    D -->|No| F[Email maintainers privately]
    
    B -->|YES| G[Bad! Exposes vulnerability]
    
    style G fill:#ff6b6b
```

### How to Report Security Issues

1. Check for `SECURITY.md` in repository
2. Look for security email in README
3. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
4. Never describe the vulnerability publicly

### Security Report Template (Private)

## Summary
[Brief description without technical details]

## Affected Versions
[Which versions are affected]

## Severity Assessment
[Your assessment: Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## Technical Details
[Detailed description - this is private]

## Proof of Concept
[Minimal code to reproduce - this is private]

## Suggested Fix
[If you have ideas]

## Disclosure Timeline
I'm happy to follow responsible disclosure. 
Please let me know your preferred timeline.
```
