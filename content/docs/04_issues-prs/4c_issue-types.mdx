# Bug Reports vs Feature Requests

import { Bug, Lightbulb, Target, AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-react'

Different types of issues require different approaches. Use the right template for faster triage.

<Callout type="info" title="The Core Distinction">
**Bug:** Something broken that should work
**Feature:** Something new that doesn't exist yet
</Callout>

## Decision Tree

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[I want to open an issue] --> B{Does it exist in code?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Is it working as designed?}
    B -->|No| D[Feature Request]
    C -->|Yes| E{Should the design change?}
    C -->|No| F[Bug Report]
    E -->|Yes| D
    E -->|No| G[Not an issue - use as-is]

## Examples

### ✅ Good Bug Report

```markdown
Title: [Auth] User session expires immediately after login on Safari 17

## Bug Description
After successful login, users are immediately logged out on Safari 17 on iOS.

## Environment
- Version: v2.1.0
- Browser: Safari 17.2 on iOS 17.2
- Device: iPhone 14 Pro

## Current Behavior
1. User logs in with correct credentials
2. Redirect to dashboard succeeds
3. Within 1-2 seconds, user is logged out
4. Forced to login again (infinite loop)

## Expected Behavior
User should remain logged in for 7 days (as per session config)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open app on Safari iOS
2. Login with test@example.com / password123
3. Watch session expire immediately

## Error Logs
```
Console: "Cookie 'session_token' set with SameSite=None but Secure flag missing"
```

## Impact
- Frequency: 100% on Safari iOS
- Affects ~15% of user base (iOS users)
- No workaround (can't login)

## Possible Cause
Safari 17 enforces stricter SameSite cookie policies. Session cookie likely missing Secure flag.
```

### ✅ Good Feature Request

```markdown
Title: [API] Add pagination to /api/users endpoint

## Problem Statement
The /api/users endpoint returns all users (10,000+) in a single response, causing:
- Slow page loads (3-5 seconds)
- Memory issues on mobile
- Wasted bandwidth

## Current Workaround
We fetch all users and paginate client-side, which is inefficient.

## Proposed Solution
Add pagination params to /api/users:
```
GET /api/users?page=1&per_page=50
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 50,
  "total": 10000,
  "total_pages": 200
}
```

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Cursor-based pagination**: More scalable but requires sorting column
2. **Offset/limit**: Simple but can be slow on large datasets

## Impact
- Who benefits: All API consumers
- Frequency: Every page load (critical path)
- Priority: High - performance blocker

## Implementation Notes
- Estimated effort: Medium (backend + tests)
- Affected endpoints: /api/users, potentially /api/posts
- Breaking change: No (default behavior stays same)

## Open Questions
- Should we default to paginated if no params provided?
- Max per_page limit to prevent abuse?
```

### ❌ Bad Examples

**Bad Bug Report:**
```
Title: It's broken

Login doesn't work. Fix it please.
```
- No details
- No reproduction
- No environment
- Useless

**Bad Feature Request:**
```
Title: Add AI

You should add AI to make the app better.
```
- Vague
- No problem statement
- No specifics
- Buzzword soup

---

## Special Cases

### Security Vulnerabilities

<Warning title="Don't Open Public Issues">
**NEVER report security issues publicly.**

Instead:
1. Check SECURITY.md for responsible disclosure process
2. Email security@project.org (usually listed in SECURITY.md)
3. Use GitHub Security Advisories (if available)
4. Give maintainers time to fix before public disclosure
</Warning>

### Documentation Issues

Can be filed as bugs if docs are wrong, or feature requests if docs are missing:

```markdown
Title: [Docs] Installation guide missing Node.js version requirement

Type: Bug (documentation is incorrect/incomplete)

Current: Docs don't mention Node version
Expected: Should state "Requires Node.js 18+"
Impact: New users can't install (Node 16 not supported)
```

## Triage Process (What Maintainers Do)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Issue Opened] --> B{Complete info?}
    B -->|No| C[Request more info]
    B -->|Yes| D{Can reproduce?}
    D -->|No| E[Can't reproduce - close]
    D -->|Yes| F{Bug or Feature?}
    F -->|Bug| G[Label: bug]
    F -->|Feature| H[Label: enhancement]
    G --> I{Severity?}
    H --> J{Priority?}
    I --> K[Assign priority]
    J --> K
    K --> L[Add to roadmap or backlog]
```

## Increasing Acceptance Chances

<CardGrid>
<Card title="For Bugs" icon={<Bug className="h-5 w-5" />}>
**Provide perfect reproduction steps.** If a maintainer can reproduce in 5 minutes, you're 10x more likely to get a fix.
</Card>

<Card title="For Features" icon={<Lightbulb className="h-5 w-5" />}>
**Focus on the problem, not your solution.** Maintainers might have better ideas. Explain the "why" clearly.
</Card>

<Card title="For Both" icon={<Target className="h-5 w-5" />}>
**Show community interest.** Link to forum discussions, tweets, or similar requests. Demonstrates real demand.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## When NOT to Open an Issue

Use **Discussions** or **Forums** instead if:

- Asking "how do I...?" questions
- Seeking debugging help for your code
- Proposing major architecture changes (needs discussion first)
- Sharing ideas without clear requirements
- Requesting support for unsupported environments
