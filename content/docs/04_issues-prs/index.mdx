## Understanding Issues

Issues are the starting point for most contributions. They can be:

- **Bug reports** — Something isn't working
- **Feature requests** — New functionality wanted
- **Documentation** — Improvements to docs
- **Questions** — Sometimes issues are just questions

Before opening a new issue, search existing ones. Your problem may already be reported.

## Pull Request Best Practices

A great PR includes:

- Clear title describing the change
