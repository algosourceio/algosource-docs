What recruiters look for:
- Contributions to recognizable projects

- Consistency over time

## Networking in Open Source

Open source networking is organic:

1. Contribute consistently to projects
2. Help others in issues and discussions
3. Attend virtual and in-person events
4. Build genuine relationships

<Warning>
Don't network just for job opportunities. Build real relationships around shared interests. Opportunities follow naturally.
</Warning>

## Leveraging Contributions

When job hunting:

- Link your GitHub prominently on resume
