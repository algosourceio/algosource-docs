# What Recruiters Look At

Understand the hiring process to stand out.

## The Screening Process

```
1. GitHub Profile
   ↓ Do you have real contributions?

2. Code Quality
   ↓ Is it good? Is it reviewed?

3. Consistency
   ↓ One-off contribution or sustained?

4. Communication
   ↓ Good commit messages? Clear PRs?

5. Problem Solving
   ↓ Can you handle complexity?

6. Collaboration
   ↓ Work well with others?
```
