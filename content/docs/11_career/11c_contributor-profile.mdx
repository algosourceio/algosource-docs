# Building a Strong Contributor Profile

Your GitHub profile is your digital resume.

## Profile Optimization

### README.md
```markdown
# Hi, I'm [Your Name]

## About Me
[2-3 sentences about you]

## Open Source Contributions
- [Project 1]: [What you did]
- [Project 2]: [What you did]
- [Project 3]: [What you did]

## Tech Stack
- Languages: [list]
- Frameworks: [list]
- Specialties: [area]

## Find Me
- Blog: [link]
- Twitter: [link]
- Email: [link]
```

### Public Activity

Best shows:
- Consistent contributions
- Quality over quantity
- Diverse projects
- Growth over time

## Demonstrating Skills

```
Language Skills:
- Show code in that language
- Ideally in real projects

System Design:
- Contribute to complex projects
- Write design docs
- Lead initiatives

Leadership:
- Mentor others
- Review PRs
- Maintain projects
```

## Portfolio vs Resume

Your portfolio is:
- GitHub profile
- Contributions history
- Blog posts
- Project repos

Better than resume because:
```
Resume: "5 years experience"
Portfolio: "Here's exactly what I built"

Resume: "Good at Python"
Portfolio: "Here are 20 Python PRs I shipped"
```
