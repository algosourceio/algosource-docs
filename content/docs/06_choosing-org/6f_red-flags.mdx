# Red Flags You Should Never Ignore

Know when to walk away.

## Immediate Deal-Breakers

### 🚫 Harassment or Discrimination

Any form of harassment based on:
- Gender, gender identity, or expression
- Sexual orientation
- Race or ethnicity
- Religion or disability
- Appearance or age

**Action**: Leave immediately. Report to GitHub/community.

### 🚫 Lack of Code of Conduct

- No CoC = No protection
- Even worse: CoC that's not enforced

### 🚫 Maintainer Abuse

Signs of abusive maintainers:
- Condescending responses to newbies
- Mocking questions in public
- Retaliatory PR closures
- Banning for disagreements

## Major Red Flags

### 🚩 Stale Project

```
6 months no commits
+ 
Dozens of unanswered issues
+
No communication on status
=
DEAD PROJECT
```

### 🚩 Active Hostility

- Regular arguments in issues
- "This is too simple" gatekeeping
- "We only accept X type of contributions"
- Making fun of contributors

### 🚩 Poor Technical Practices

- No tests whatsoever
- Merging without review
- Ignoring security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes without notice

### 🚩 One-Person Project with Burnout

Signs:
- Frustrated tone in responses
- "I can't maintain this anymore"
- Closing issues without response
- Taking 6-month hiatuses

**Reality**: One person gets exhausted. You may be abandoned.

### 🚩 Forced Monetization

- "I'll only review PRs if you donate"
- Selling access to documentation
- Demanding payment for maintenance

### 🚩 Drama or Politics

Indicators:
- Regular public conflicts
- Faction-based contributions
- Maintainers leaving publicly
- Community split/fork wars

### 🚩 Ownership Disputes

- Unclear who owns the project
- Conflicting maintainers
- Copyright disputes
- License confusion

## Subtle Red Flags

### The Stalling PR

```
You submit PR on Month 1
No response for Month 1-2
Maintainer comes back with massive critique
You're frustrated
PR dies
```

Common in projects where:
- Reviews are done in batches (not ongoing)
- Maintainers have other priorities
- Standards are unclear

### The Invisible Hand-Off

Project moving from active maintainers to someone new, nobody told you.

### The Silent Zombie

- Project is "maintained"
- But only security patches, no features
- No communication about direction
- You're second-guessing if it's dead

## Questions That Reveal Red Flags

1. "What should I work on first?" - Listen to the response tone
2. "What's your contribution process?" - Should be clear, not vague
3. "How often do you release?" - Should have a pattern
4. "What happened to that PR from 6 months ago?" - Watch reaction
5. "How do you handle disagreements?" - Reveals conflict resolution style

## Decision Tree

```
Does project have CoC?
  No  → Walk away
  Yes → Continue

Is there active harassment?
  Yes → Walk away
  No  → Continue

Last commit < 6 months ago?
  No  → Risky, be cautious
  Yes → Continue

Any responses in 100 recent issues?
  None → Dead project
  Some → Continue
  All  → Responsive!

Overall feel during research?
  Nervous → Trust your gut
  Excited → Good sign
```

## If You Discover Red Flags Later

1. You can always switch projects
2. Keep your contributions public (your portfolio)
3. Learn from the experience
4. Share learnings to warn others
