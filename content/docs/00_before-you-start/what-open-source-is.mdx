# What Open Source Really Is (and Is Not)

Let's cut through the noise and understand what open source actually means in practice.

## The Definition

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can:

- **Inspect** — See how it works
- **Modify** — Change it to fit their needs  
- **Distribute** — Share with others

But that's just the license. The *culture* of open source is much more.

<Callout type="info" title="Open Source vs Free Software">
"Open Source" and "Free Software" are often used interchangeably, but they have different philosophical roots. Open source emphasizes practical benefits; free software emphasizes user freedom.
</Callout>

## What Open Source IS

### A Collaboration Model

Open source is fundamentally about people working together:

```
Maintainer
    ↓
Core Contributors → Review changes → Accept/Reject
    ↑
Community Contributors → Submit changes
```

### A Meritocracy (Mostly)

Your contributions are judged on their quality, not your background. This is liberating—but also demanding.

### A Learning Environment

You'll learn from:
- Reading production-quality code
- Receiving code reviews from experts
- Working on real-world problems

### A Career Accelerator

Open source contributions:
- Build a public portfolio
- Demonstrate real skills
- Create networking opportunities

## What Open Source is NOT

<Warning>
Understanding what open source is NOT will save you months of frustration.
</Warning>

### NOT Free Labor for Companies

You're not obligated to fix bugs or add features. Your time is valuable.

### NOT a Shortcut

There's no "hack" to open source success. It takes:
- Time to understand codebases
- Patience to navigate community dynamics
- Persistence through rejection

### NOT Always Welcoming

Some projects have toxic communities. Some maintainers are overwhelmed. Choose carefully.

### NOT Just About Code

Successful contributors also:
- Write documentation
- Triage issues
- Help other users
- Review pull requests

## The Reality

Here's what a typical open source journey looks like:

| Stage | Timeline | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Learning | Weeks 1-4 | Understanding project, failing, learning |
| First PR | Weeks 4-8 | Small contribution, possibly rejected |
| Recognition | Months 3-6 | Maintainers start recognizing your name |
| Trust | Months 6-12 | Given more responsibility, faster reviews |
| Core | Year 1+ | Potentially become a maintainer |
