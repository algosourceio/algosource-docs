# Time Commitment & Expectations

Let's be honest about what open source contribution actually requires.

## Realistic Time Investment

<CardGrid>
<Card title="Getting Started">
**5-15 hours/week** for first 1-2 months

- Learning the codebase
- Setting up development environment
- Understanding contribution guidelines
- Making first contributions
</Card>

<Card title="Regular Contributor">
**3-8 hours/week** ongoing

- Making contributions
- Responding to reviews
- Staying updated with project
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## The Hidden Time Costs

What most guides don't tell you:

| Activity | Time Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| Reading and understanding code | 60% of your time |
| Waiting for reviews | Days to weeks |
| Addressing review feedback | 2-5 iterations typical |
| Debugging environment issues | Hours on first setup |
| Community communication | Ongoing overhead |

<Callout type="warning">
Coding is often less than 30% of open source contribution. The rest is communication, waiting, and learning.
</Callout>

## Setting Expectations

### What "Success" Looks Like

```
Month 1: Submitted first PR (maybe rejected)
Month 2: Got a PR merged
Month 3: Maintainers recognize your name
Month 6: Trusted for small features
Year 1+: Core contributor potential
```

### What Failure Looks Like

- Giving up after first rejection
- Expecting immediate recognition
- Trying to do too much too fast
- Not communicating with maintainers

## Building Sustainable Habits

<Steps>
<Step number={1} title="Set a schedule">
Block 2-3 specific times per week for open source work. Consistency matters more than intensity.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Start smaller than you think">
Your first contribution should be almost embarrassingly small. A typo fix is perfect.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Track your progress">
Keep a log of your contributions. It's motivating to see progress over time.
</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Join the community">
Discord, Slack, mailing lists—be present. Relationships accelerate everything.
</Step>
</Steps>

## When to Walk Away

Not every project is worth your time. Leave if:

- Maintainers are consistently rude
- Your PRs sit unreviewed for months
- The community is toxic
- The project isn't actively maintained

<Warning title="Your Time is Valuable">
Don't stay in a project that doesn't respect your contributions. There are thousands of great projects that would value your help.
</Warning>

## The Payoff

After 6-12 months of consistent contribution:

- You'll deeply understand a codebase
- You'll have public proof of skills
- You'll have professional connections
- You'll be a more confident developer
