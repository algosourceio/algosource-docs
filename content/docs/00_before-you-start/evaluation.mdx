# How Contributions Are Evaluated

Understanding how maintainers evaluate contributions will dramatically improve your success rate.

## What Maintainers Look For

### 1. Does It Solve a Real Problem?

The best contributions:
- Fix a documented issue
- Address user pain points
- Improve project maintainability

<Warning>
Unsolicited features often get rejected. Always check if the maintainers want the feature before building it.
</Warning>

### 2. Code Quality

Maintainers evaluate:

```typescript
// ❌ Poor
function f(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

// ✅ Good
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers
 */
function calculateSum(firstNumber: number, secondNumber: number): number {
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
```

Key aspects:
- Clear naming
- Appropriate comments
- Consistent style with project
- No unnecessary changes

### 3. Test Coverage

<Callout type="info">
A PR without tests is often automatically rejected, especially for new features or bug fixes.
</Callout>

Include:
- Unit tests for new code
- Regression tests for bugs
- Integration tests when appropriate

### 4. Documentation

Your PR should update:
- Code comments
- README if applicable
- API documentation
- CHANGELOG

### 5. Commit Quality

```bash
# ❌ Bad
git commit -m "fix stuff"

# ✅ Good  
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve token expiration check

Previously, tokens were not properly validated against
expiration time. This caused users to remain logged in
after their session should have expired.

Fixes #123"
```

## The Evaluation Checklist

What maintainers mentally check:

<Checklist>
<ChecklistItem>Does this PR have a clear purpose?</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>Is the code quality acceptable?</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>Are there tests?</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>Does it follow project conventions?</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>Is the scope appropriate (not too big)?</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>Has the contributor been responsive?</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>Will this be maintainable long-term?</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

## Why PRs Get Rejected

| Reason | How to Avoid |
|--------|--------------|
| Unsolicited feature | Ask first |
| Too large | Break into smaller PRs |
| Poor code quality | Follow project style |
| No tests | Always include tests |
| Unresponsive author | Reply within 48 hours |
| Scope creep | One change per PR |
| Conflicts | Keep branch updated |

## Red Flags for Maintainers

Things that make maintainers wary:

- Large refactors without discussion
- Changing code style throughout project
- Ignoring review feedback
- Arguing instead of adapting
- Disappearing after submitting PR

<Callout type="success" title="The Golden Rule">
Make the maintainer's life easier, not harder. A well-prepared PR with clear description, tests, and documentation is a gift.
</Callout>
