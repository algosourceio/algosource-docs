<Callout type="warning" title="Most documentation skips this section">
This is where 90% of contributors fail—before they even write a line of code. Don't skip this.
</Callout>

Most open source documentation jumps straight into "how to fork a repo." That's a mistake. This section exists because the **#1 reason contributors fail isn't technical—it's misaligned expectations**.

## Why This Section Exists

Every maintainer has seen it:

- Contributors who disappear after their first PR review
- PRs that sit for months with no response from the author
- First-timers who expect instant recognition
- People who give up after one rejection

**This section filters unserious contributors early** and saves everyone's time—including yours.

## The Hard Truth

<Warning title="Read this before proceeding">
Open source contribution is **not**:
- A shortcut to getting hired
- A way to get quick fame
- Easy or fast
- Always welcoming

It **is**:
- A long-term investment
- A learning opportunity
- Sometimes frustrating
- Ultimately rewarding for those who persist
</Warning>

## Self-Assessment

Before diving in, honestly answer these questions:

<Checklist>
<ChecklistItem>I can commit 5-10 hours per week for at least 3 months</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>I'm okay with my first few contributions taking weeks to get reviewed</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>I can handle rejection and use it as a learning opportunity</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>I'm interested in learning, not just adding GitHub green squares</ChecklistItem>
<ChecklistItem>I understand maintainers are volunteers with limited time</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

If you checked all boxes, you're ready. If not, that's okay—come back when you are.
