<Callout type="info" title="Path to Maintainer">
Becoming a maintainer isn't about asking—it's about demonstrating responsibility over time. Most projects promote contributors who consistently help without being asked.
</Callout>

## The Unwritten Rules

### For New Contributors

- Don't ask "can I work on this?" on every issue—just start
- Communicate early if you're stuck
- A rejected PR isn't personal
- Small PRs get reviewed faster

### For Growing Contributors

- Help others more than you ask for help
- Review PRs before submitting your own
- Take on "boring" work (tests, docs)
- Be reliable with your commitments

<Warning>
Never claim an issue and then disappear. If you can't complete something, communicate that. Ghosting damages your reputation.
</Warning>

## Building Trust

| First PR merged | Newcomer |
| 5+ quality PRs | Known |
