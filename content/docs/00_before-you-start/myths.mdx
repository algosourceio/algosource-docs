# Common Myths New Contributors Believe

These misconceptions cause most new contributors to fail. Let's debunk them.

## Myth 1: "I Need to Be an Expert"

**Reality:** Most open source contributions come from people learning as they go.

<Callout type="success">
Many successful contributors started with typo fixes, documentation updates, or simple bug fixes. Expertise comes from contributing, not before it.
</Callout>

What you actually need:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Ability to read documentation
- Willingness to learn
- Patience

## Myth 2: "My First PR Will Get Merged Quickly"

**Reality:** Your first few PRs will likely:
- Take weeks to get reviewed
- Require multiple rounds of changes
- Possibly get rejected

This is normal. Maintainers are:
- Volunteers with limited time
- Protective of code quality
- Building trust in you

## Myth 3: "Big Contributions = More Recognition"

**Reality:** Maintainers often prefer:
- Small, focused changes
- Well-tested code
- Good documentation
- Consistent contributors over one-time heroes

<Warning title="The Hero Complex">
Don't try to rewrite half the codebase in your first month. Start small, build trust, then take on bigger tasks.
</Warning>

## Myth 4: "I Just Need to Code"

**Reality:** Successful contributors also:

| Activity | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Triaging issues | Helps maintainers focus |
| Writing docs | Helps new users |
| Reviewing PRs | Improves code quality |
| Answering questions | Builds community |
| Testing | Catches bugs early |

## Myth 5: "Open Source is Always Welcoming"

**Reality:** Communities vary widely:

- Some are incredibly welcoming with mentorship programs
- Some are overwhelmed and slow to respond
- Some have toxic dynamics

<Callout type="warning" title="Choose Wisely">
Research a project's community before investing time. Look at how maintainers respond to issues and PRs.
</Callout>

## Myth 6: "Once I Contribute, Companies Will Hire Me"

**Reality:** Open source helps, but:
- Quantity doesn't equal quality
- Context matters (what you contributed, to which projects)
- You still need interview skills
- It's one signal among many

## Myth 7: "Maintainers Owe Me a Response"

**Reality:** Maintainers are volunteers. They:
- Have jobs, families, and lives
- Get hundreds of notifications
- May take weeks to respond
- May never respond at all
