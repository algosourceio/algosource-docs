<Callout type="info" title="The Most Underestimated Factor">
Time investment is the #1 reason contributors quit. This page gives you honest numbers so you can plan accordingly.
</Callout>

## Time Investment Reality Check

Let's be brutally honest about how much time open source contribution takes:

### Weekly Time Commitment

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level           │  Hours/Week  │  Duration           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Casual          │  2-5 hrs     │  Ongoing            │
│  Consistent      │  5-10 hrs    │  6+ months          │
│  Serious         │  10-20 hrs   │  1+ year            │
│  Core Team       │  20+ hrs     │  Multi-year         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Warning title="Be Honest With Yourself">
If you can't commit at least 5 hours per week for 6 months, your contributions will likely fizzle out. That's okay—but know it upfront.
</Warning>

## The Contribution Timeline

## The Hidden Time Costs

What nobody tells you about where the time actually goes:

### 1. Waiting (50% of Your "Time")

### 2. Context Switching

Every time you come back to a PR after days/weeks, you need to:

- Re-read your code
- Remember the discussion
- Understand new feedback
- Rebase/resolve conflicts

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Keep notes on each PR. When you step away, write down where you are and what's next. Your future self will thank you.
</Callout>

### 3. Communication

More time than you expect goes to:

| Activity | Time | Frequency |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Writing detailed PR descriptions | 30-60 min | Every PR |
| Responding to review comments | 15-30 min | Multiple times |
| Asking clarifying questions | 15-30 min | As needed |
| Participating in issue discussions | 30-60 min | Weekly |
| Reading project announcements | 15-30 min | Weekly |

### 4. Tool Setup & Debugging

- Setting up the development environment: 2-8 hours
- Debugging CI failures: 30 min - 2 hours per PR
- Keeping your fork in sync: 15 min weekly
- Learning project-specific tools: 2-5 hours initially

## Setting Realistic Goals

### 🎯 Good Goals

<div className="bg-emerald-500/10 border border-emerald-500/30 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
<ul className="space-y-2 text-neutral-300">
<li>✓ "I'll make one meaningful contribution per month"</li>
<li>✓ "I'll spend 5 hours per week for the next 6 months"</li>
<li>✓ "I'll become a recognized contributor to [Project] by end of year"</li>
<li>✓ "I'll learn this codebase well enough to fix medium-sized bugs"</li>
</ul>
</div>

### 🚫 Unrealistic Goals

<div className="bg-red-500/10 border border-red-500/30 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
<ul className="space-y-2 text-neutral-300">
<li>✗ "I'll become a core maintainer in 3 months"</li>
<li>✗ "I'll get hired by contributing for 2 months"</li>
<li>✗ "I'll contribute to 10 different projects this month"</li>
<li>✗ "I'll have 100 PRs merged by end of year"</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Time Management Strategies

<CardGrid>
<Card title="Batch Your Work" icon={<Clock className="h-5 w-5" />}>
Set aside 2-3 hour blocks instead of 30-minute snippets. Deep work is more effective.
</Card>

<Card title="Use Dead Time" icon={<Clock className="h-5 w-5" />}>
Code review, issue triage, and documentation can be done on mobile during commutes.
</Card>

<Card title="Accept Wait Times" icon={<Calendar className="h-5 w-5" />}>
Don't let waiting block you. Work on multiple PRs or projects in parallel.
</Card>

<Card title="Track Your Time" icon={<TrendingUp className="h-5 w-5" />}>
For the first month, track how you actually spend time. You'll be surprised.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## The Compound Effect

<Callout type="tip" title="Consistency Beats Intensity">
5 hours/week for a year beats 40 hours in one month. Consistency builds reputation, relationships, and deep knowledge.
