Core Team (3-6 months)
    ↓ Regular, critical work

Official Maintainer
```

## Requirements

Usually need:
- 1-2+ years of consistent contributions
- Demonstrated code quality
- Good judgment
- Reliable communication
- Time availability

## Invitation Process

Most projects:
1. Contribute consistently
2. Earn trust
3. Maintainer asks if interested
4. Formal role assignment

Don't ask to be maintainer. Show you belong to the role first.
