# Writing Design Docs

Major changes need written plans.

## When to Write a Design Doc

- Large feature (> 2 weeks of work)
- Architectural change
- API modifications
- Security-related changes
- Cross-team impact

## Design Doc Template

```markdown
# Design Doc: [Feature Name]

## Problem
[What problem does this solve?]

## Proposed Solution
[How you'll solve it]

## Architecture
[Diagrams, components, interactions]

## Timeline
[Rough estimate]

## Risks & Mitigations
[What could go wrong and how to handle it]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other approaches and why this is better]

## Questions for Community
[What feedback do you need?]
```

## Benefits

```
Before:
"Let's implement X"
[Weeks of work]
[Doesn't fit with project]
[Wasted effort]

After:
[Design doc circulates]
[Community provides feedback]
[Issues caught early]
[Smooth implementation]
```

> **Design docs save time.** Get agreement on approach before coding.
