# Understanding the Problem Statement

The best proposals show deep problem understanding.

## What Mentors Want to Hear

```
"I understand why this matters" >>> "I will do what you ask"

A mentor reading your proposal thinks:
"Can this person solve the right problem?"
"Or will they solve something wrong really well?"

Understanding the problem = 40% of success
```

## The Deep Dive: Real Example

```markdown
WEAK Understanding:
"The project needs caching. I will add Redis caching."

STRONG Understanding:
"Current system makes 500+ DB queries per page load
(traced via New Relic profiling). 70% are repetitive
user profile queries (same 100 users accessed repeatedly).
Current caching is 5-min TTL, no smart invalidation.
This causes stale data issues in high-frequency scenarios.
I propose Redis with event-based invalidation, which
solves stale data + reduces QPS by 60% based on
similar implementations in [Project X and Y]."

The difference: One shows thinking. One shows understanding.

## Analysis Process

<Steps>

### Read the Official Description
- What does it literally say?
- What's the stated goal?

### Read Between the Lines
- Why would they request this?
- What pain point does this solve?
- Who benefits?

### Research the Context
- Look at related issues
- Check discussions on this topic
- See what's already been tried

### Ask Questions
- Join community channels
- Discuss with mentors
- Don't make assumptions

</Steps>

## Questions to Answer in Proposal

1. What is the problem?
2. Who is affected by it?
3. What's the current state?
4. Why isn't it fixed yet?
5. How will your solution help?
6. What's the success criteria?
