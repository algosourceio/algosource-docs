# Creating a Realistic Timeline

Timelines separate serious proposals from fantasies.

## The Reality Padding

```
Work Time Estimate: 5 days
  + Code review iterations: +2 days
  + Unexpected blockers: +3 days
  + Learning curve: +2 days
  + Testing & fixes: +3 days
  + Slack/meetings/discussions: +2 days
  ___
  Real Time: 17 days (3.4x estimate!)

This is why aggressive timelines fail.
```

## Realistic Timeline Rules

```
Rule 1: Every task takes 2-3x longer than estimated
Rule 2: Code reviews add 1-2 weeks per feature
Rule 3: Unexpected issues eat 10-20% of time
Rule 4: Testing/polish adds 30% to timeline
Rule 5: Communication takes time nobody accounts for

Formula for realistic timeline:
Estimated time × 2.5 = Actual time needed
```

## Timeline Structure

For a 12-week program:

```
Weeks 1-2:   Setup & Learning (20% of time)
Weeks 3-7:   Core Implementation (50% of time)
Weeks 8-10:  Testing & Polish (20% of time)
Week 11-12:  Buffer & Documentation (10% of time)
```

## Example Timeline

```markdown
## Implementation Timeline (12 weeks)

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Understand codebase architecture
- [ ] Design technical spec
- [ ] Get mentor approval

### Week 3-5: Core Feature A
- [ ] Implement [component]
- [ ] Unit tests (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Code review & iteration
- [ ] Merge to main branch

### Week 6-8: Core Feature B
[Similar structure]

### Week 9-10: Integration & Optimization
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Edge case handling
- [ ] Code review

### Week 11: Polish & Documentation
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Create demo/walkthrough
- [ ] Final bug fixes
- [ ] Merge remaining PRs

### Week 12: Buffer & Contingency
- [ ] Address mentor feedback
- [ ] Final testing
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Prepare final report
```

## Buffer Time Rules

- 10-20%: For reviews and revisions
- 10-15%: For unexpected blockers
- 5-10%: For learning gaps

## Red Flags in Timelines

- ❌ No mention of code review
- ❌ Back-to-back milestones with no buffer
- ❌ "Complete entire project in week 1"
- ❌ No time for testing
- ❌ No learning time at start
