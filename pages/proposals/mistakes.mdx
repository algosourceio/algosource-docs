# Common Proposal Mistakes

Learn from others' failures.

## Mistake #1: Generic Proposals

```
❌ Wrong:
"I will work on the ideas mentioned in your 
project ideas page."

✅ Right:
"The project needs better caching. I will 
implement Redis-based caching for post queries, 
addressing issue #456. This will reduce database 
load by 40% and improve latency."
```

## Mistake #2: Unrealistic Scope

```
❌ Wrong Timeline (10 weeks):
- Redesign entire architecture
- Rewrite 50,000 lines of code
- Add 10 new major features
- Achieve 99.99% uptime

✅ Right Timeline (10 weeks):
- Implement feature X (weeks 1-3)
- Add tests and documentation (weeks 4-5)
- Optimize and polish (weeks 6-8)
- Buffer for reviews (weeks 9-10)
```

## Mistake #3: Zero Prior Contributions

```
❌ "I'm very interested and quick learner"
✅ "I've already submitted PR #123, which was merged"
```

## Mistake #4: Unclear Timeline

```
❌ "Around 3-4 weeks for the main feature"
✅ 
- Week 1-2: Database schema design and migration
- Week 3-4: API implementation and testing
- Week 5: Performance optimization
```

## Mistake #5: No Contingency Plan

```
❌ Perfect timeline with zero buffer
✅ Timeline with 20% buffer for reviews and 
   blockers, plus fallback plan if blocked
```

## Mistake #6: Ignoring the Brief

```
❌ Proposing something unrelated to project ideas
✅ Addressing specific points from project description
```

## Mistake #7: Poor English

- Grammar errors suggest carelessness
- Spell check before submitting
- Have someone proofread

## Mistake #8: Too Long

```
❌ 50-page proposal
✅ 5-10 page proposal with clear sections
```

Mentors won't read it all. Be concise.

## Mistake #9: Making Assumptions

```
❌ "I assume the current approach is X"
✅ "The current approach is X [with link to code], 
   and I will improve it by..."
```

## Mistake #10: No Questions for Mentors

```
❌ Silent proposal submitted
✅ "I'm concerned about Y. Is my approach correct? 
   I was considering Z as alternative."
```

Shows you're thinking critically.
