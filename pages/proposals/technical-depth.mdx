# Technical Depth vs Buzzwords

Buzzwords hide ignorance. Depth shows competence.

## Buzzword Detox

### ❌ Before (Buzzword Salad)

```
"I will leverage machine learning with blockchain 
integration and cloud-native architecture to create 
a scalable, synergistic solution that optimizes 
stakeholder value through disruptive innovation."

Translation: "I have no idea what I'm doing."
```

### ✅ After (Real Technical Depth)

```
"I will implement a caching layer using Redis 
with LRU eviction policy, cache invalidation 
on writes, and fallback to PostgreSQL queries 
if cache misses exceed threshold."

Translation: "I know what I'm talking about."
```

## How to Show Depth

### 1. Explain the Why

```
❌ Shallow:
"I will use Docker for deployment."

✅ Deep:
"Docker allows reproducible environments and 
simplifies CI/CD. I'll use multi-stage builds 
to minimize image size and leverage layer caching 
for faster builds."
```

### 2. Discuss Trade-offs

```
"I considered:
- Option A (pros/cons)
- Option B (pros/cons)
- I'm choosing Option C because [specific reasons]"
```

### 3. Acknowledge Challenges

```
"This approach has risks:
1. Cache coherency in distributed setup
   → Mitigation: TTL-based invalidation
   
2. Complexity in testing
   → Mitigation: Test fixture factories"
```

## Depth Checklist


- [ ] **Specific technology choices** with reasoning
- [ ] **Trade-offs considered** and explained
- [ ] **Potential challenges** and mitigations
- [ ] **Testing strategy** with concrete examples
- [ ] **Performance considerations** and metrics
- [ ] **Security implications** thought through
