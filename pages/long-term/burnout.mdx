# Burnout Prevention

Volunteer work shouldn't burn you out.

## Warning Signs

```
✓ You're excited about contributions
✓ You enjoy the community

✗ You feel obligated to respond 24/7
✗ You're frustrated with ungrateful users
✗ You can't say no to requests
✗ The work feels like a job
✗ You're not sleeping well
```

## Preventing Burnout

### Set Boundaries

```
This is NOT your job:
- 24/7 support
- Free custom features
- Handling entitled users
- Being the sole maintainer

You're allowed to:
- Take breaks
- Say no
- Go on vacation
- Step back if needed
```

### Time Management

```
Healthy:
- 5-10 hours/week max
- Scheduled times, not random
- Fixed commitment, not open-ended
- Clear off-duty hours

Unhealthy:
- 30+ hours/week
- On-call all the time
- Never-ending tasks
- No boundaries
```

### Community Support

```
You need:
- Other maintainers to share load
- Delegated decision-making
- Helper contributors
- Clear expectations
```

### Self-Care

- Take actual vacations
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Delegate when possible
- Close laptop at fixed time
- Have life outside open source

## If You're Burning Out

**It's okay to:**
- Take a break
- Reduce involvement
- Delegate more
- Hand off to others
- Step down entirely

Your health matters more than any project.
