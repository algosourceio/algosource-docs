```
1. Read the PR description
   ↓ Understand what they're trying to do

2. Check the code changes
   ↓ Does it do what it claims?

   ↓ Are there bugs? Edge cases?

4. Verify tests
   ↓ Are they adequate? Do they pass?

5. Provide feedback
   ↓ Be kind and constructive
```

## Review Comments

```
❌ Bad:
"This is wrong"

✅ Good:
"I see you're using sync queries here. 
 For large datasets, this could block 
 the event loop. Did you consider using 
 async/await? Here's an example: [link]"
```
