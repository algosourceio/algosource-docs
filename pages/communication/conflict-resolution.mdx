# Disagreements & Conflict Resolution

You will disagree with maintainers. Handle it well.

## Common Disagreements

| Scenario | Example | How to Handle |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Scope** | "This PR is too large" | Negotiate or split |
| **Design** | "Use pattern X not Y" | Ask why, learn, adapt |
| **Priority** | "This isn't important" | Understand their perspective |
| **Standards** | "Code doesn't meet style guide" | Fix it or discuss |

## The Escalation Ladder

```
Level 1: Clarification
"I don't understand why. Can you explain?"

Level 2: Discussion
"I see your point. What about [alternative]?"

Level 3: Second Opinion
"Can we get feedback from [other expert]?"

Level 4: Acceptance
"I disagree but I understand. Let's go with your approach."

Level 5: Stepping Away
"This won't work for me. I'll look for another project."
```

## How to Disagree

### ❌ Bad Way

```
"That's a terrible approach. You're wrong."
```

### ✅ Good Way

```
"I understand your approach. I was thinking of [alternative] 
because [reasoning]. What's your take on [concern]?"
```

## De-escalation Phrases

```
"Help me understand..."
"I might be missing context..."
"You're the maintainer, so..."
"I defer to your judgment..."
"Let me think about that..."
"You have a good point..."
```

## When to Step Back

- Maintainer is absolutely right
- You misunderstood the standards
- Personality clash is too strong
- Project values don't align

Graceful retreat earns respect.

## Learn from Conflict

After disagreement:
1. Understand why they disagreed
2. Learn the underlying principle
3. Apply it to future work
