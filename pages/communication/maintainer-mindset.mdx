# How Maintainers Think

Empathy for maintainers makes you a better contributor.

## The Maintainer Reality

### Time Scarcity

Maintainers are:
- Probably volunteers
- Juggling other projects
- Dealing with critical bugs
- Handling user complaints
- Still have day jobs

```
Your PR: Great feature!
Maintainer's mind: I need to review 47 other PRs first
```

### Responsibility

Maintainers think about:
- Breaking changes
- Security implications
- Performance impact
- Maintenance burden
- Future complexity

```
Your idea: Add this cool feature!
Maintainer's mind: Who maintains it in 5 years?
```

### Trust Issues

They've seen:
- Broken PRs merged
- Security holes introduced
- Abandoned features
- Unmaintainable code

```
Your PR seems fine
Maintainer's mind: Is it actually production-ready?
```

## What Actually Frustrates Maintainers (Real Examples)

### #1: No Context in PR

```
❌ BAD PR:
Title: "Fix bug"
Description: "Found a bug, fixed it. Tests pass."

Maintainer's reaction:
- What bug?
- Why is this the right fix?
- Did you consider X, Y, Z?
- I have to ask for details
- Time wasted

✓ GOOD PR:
Title: "Fix race condition in WebSocket handler"
Description:
"Issue: When two messages arrive simultaneously,
the handler can lose one message because
the state isn't properly locked.

Fix: Added mutex around state mutation.

Testing: Wrote test that fails without lock,
passes with lock. Ran full test suite.

Alternatives considered:
- Using atomic operations (too complex for this case)
- Async queue (overkill, adds latency)"

Maintainer's reaction:
- Clear what problem I'm solving
- I trust the fix is right
- I can approve with confidence
- Minimal back-and-forth
```

### #2: Not Following Guidelines

```
❌ BAD: PR with 1000 lines of code + no tests

Maintainer's mind:
"How do I review this? No tests means I have to
manually verify everything. Plus it touches
10 different features. If one breaks, which
change caused it?"

Time spent reviewing: 2+ hours for 1 PR

✓ GOOD: PR with 100 lines + complete tests

Maintainer's mind:
"Tests pass. CI is green. Changes are focused
on one thing. I can review in 15 minutes."

Time spent reviewing: 15 minutes
```

### #3: Pushing for Merging Too Soon

```
❌ BAD: 
Mon: Open PR
Wed: "Hey, is this ready for merge?"
Fri: "This has been pending 3 days, can you merge?"

Maintainer's reaction: Annoyed. You don't understand
their time constraints. This gets deprioritized.

✓ GOOD:
Mon: Open PR with clear description
Mon-Wed: Respond to feedback, improve code
Wed: Ask "Anything else you need from me?"
After merge: Learn and contribute more

Maintainer's reaction: Helpful, understanding person.
Fast-track future PRs.
```

### #4: Questions Without Research

```
❌ BAD:
Issue: "How do I use this API?"
(Answer is in README, 5 seconds of reading)

Maintainer's thought: Another person who didn't
read the docs. This is the 10th question today.

✓ GOOD:
Issue: "I read the README section 4.2 about API.
It mentions X but doesn't explain how Y works.
I tried [approach] and got [error]. What am I missing?"

Maintainer's thought: This person did their homework.
Worth my time to answer properly.
```

## The Maintainer Decision Matrix

When reviewing your PR, they're asking:

```
Question 1: Is this code correct?
- YES → Continue
- NO → Reject, ask for fix

Question 2: Does this add maintenance burden?
- NO → Continue
- YES → Is it worth it? If no → Reject

Question 3: Is this aligned with project goals?
- YES → Continue
- NO → Reject or suggest changes

Question 4: Will this break anything?
- NO → Approve
- YES → Ask for safeguards
```

## What Maintainers Actually Need From You

| Need | What It Means | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Clear communication** | I understand the problem immediately | "Fixes race condition in cache invalidation" |
| **Well-tested code** | I'm confident it works | "Includes test covering the failure case" |
| **Minimal scope** | Review is faster | "Only changes parser, leaves serializer alone" |
| **Respect for process** | You follow our standards | "Added tests + docs as per CONTRIBUTING.md" |
| **Reliability** | You follow through | "Responds to feedback, fixes issues quickly" |

## Real Talk: The Maintainer's Day

```
A maintainer's typical review session:

1. Open GitHub → 30 new notifications
2. 25 are spam/notifications they don't care about
3. 5 are actual stuff needing attention
4. Check: "Can I understand this in 5 minutes?"
   - If NO → Deprioritize (too complex)
   - If YES → Review in 5 minutes
5. Write feedback
6. Move on

Your goal: Make your PR reviewable in 5 minutes.

How?
- Write great description
- Keep it focused
- Include tests
- Follow conventions
```

5. "Just a small change" touching 5 files
```

## Ask Yourself

Before reaching out:
- [ ] Did I read the docs?
- [ ] Did I search existing issues?
- [ ] Is this a real problem or my confusion?
- [ ] Have I done the homework?
- [ ] Am I respecting their time?
