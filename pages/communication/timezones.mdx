# Respecting Time Zones

Open source is global. Respect that.

## The Reality

```
You submit PR at 9 AM your time
↓
Maintainer might be sleeping (9 PM their time)
↓
Waits until they wake up (8 hours later)
↓
They review during their morning
↓
You get response at 11 PM your time
```

## What This Means

- Expect 24-48 hour response times
- Plan accordingly, don't stress after 2 hours
- Don't ask for urgent responses
- Be considerate of working hours

## Time Zone Awareness

When communicating:

- [ ] Avoid saying "ASAP" or "urgent"
- [ ] Don't expect immediate responses
- [ ] Use async communication
- [ ] Schedule syncs fairly (alternate times)
- [ ] Document decisions for absent people

## Synchronous Meetings

If pairing or meeting required:

```
Before scheduling:
"What's your timezone? 
I'm UTC+5:30, flexible with timing."

Fair rotation:
- This week: My 6 PM (your 8 AM)
- Next week: My 2 PM (your 4 AM) - I notice this sucks for you
- Alternate times each meeting
```

## Documentation

Because not everyone can attend:

- Record meetings (with permission)
- Write summary in issue
- Share action items
- Include decisions made
