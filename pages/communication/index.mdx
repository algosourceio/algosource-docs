# Communication & Open Source Etiquette

How you communicate matters as much as your code.

## The Communication Reality

```
Bad communicators in open source:
- PRs sit unreviewed
- Questions go unanswered
- Misunderstandings cascade
- Contributors leave
- Project quality suffers

Good communicators in open source:
- Fast PR turnarounds
- Issues resolved quickly
- Mentored by maintainers
- Become core team quickly
- Shape project direction

Communication > Code Skills (at senior levels)
```

## The Core Principles

## Why Communication Fails

| Failure Mode | Why It Happens | Solution |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Misunderstanding** | Assumptions | Ask clarifying questions |
| **Silence** | Too busy to update | Brief status updates |
| **Conflict** | Tone lost in text | Use kind language |
| **Decisions Made Without You** | Not in the room | Ask to be included |
