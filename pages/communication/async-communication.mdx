# Async Communication Best Practices

Open source is distributed. Master async communication.

## The Async Advantage

```
Sync (Real-time):
- Fast feedback
- But requires both present
- High context switching

Async (Delayed):
- Works across timezones
- Everyone can think
- Better documentation
- No interruptions
```

## How to Async Well

### 1. Write Clearly

```
❌ Sync style:
"Hey, quick question about the thing"

✅ Async style:
"Question: In database.py line 42, why use 
synchronous queries instead of async? 
Is it intentional or for simplicity right now?"
```

### 2. Provide Context

```
❌ Unclear:
"This doesn't work"

✅ Clear:
"When I run `npm test`, the integration 
tests fail with 'ENOENT' error. Happens 
on main branch too. Details: [log excerpt]"
```

### 3. Don't Demand Urgency

```
❌ Wrong:
"Really need this reviewed ASAP!!!"

✅ Right:
"No rush, but when you get a chance, 
this is ready for review."
```

### 4. Use Threads/Replies

- Keep conversations grouped
- Don't spam multiple channels
- Use replies in discussions

### 5. Summarize Decisions

```
After discussion, summary:
- We decided to use approach X
- Rationale: [reasoning]
- Next steps: [concrete actions]
```

## Async Communication Rules


- [ ] **Self-contained**: Include all needed context
- [ ] **Clear**: Anyone could understand
- [ ] **Specific**: Not vague or hand-wavy
- [ ] **Patient**: Expect 24-48h response times
- [ ] **Documented**: Write it down for future reference
