# Finding Good First Issues

Not all "good first issues" are actually good. Learn to find the real opportunities.

## Where to Find Issues

### 1. GitHub Labels

Most projects use labels to mark beginner-friendly issues:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `good first issue` | Official GitHub label for beginners |
| `help wanted` | Maintainers actively seeking help |
| `beginner-friendly` | Custom label, same meaning |
| `easy` | Low complexity |
| `documentation` | Doc-related (often good for starters) |
| `hacktoberfest` | Valid for Hacktoberfest |

### 2. Search Queries

```
# On GitHub, use these searches:

# All good first issues in a language
label:"good first issue" language:javascript

# Good first issues with no assignee
label:"good first issue" no:assignee

# Recent good first issues (last 7 days)
label:"good first issue" created:>2024-01-01

# In specific organization
org:facebook label:"good first issue"
```

### 3. Dedicated Platforms

| Platform | URL | Best For |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Good First Issues | goodfirstissues.com | Curated beginner issues |
| Up For Grabs | up-for-grabs.net | Variety of projects |
| First Timers Only | firsttimersonly.com | First contribution ever |
| CodeTriage | codetriage.com | Helping with triage |
| Awesome for Beginners | github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners | Curated list |

### 4. Program-Specific Sources

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Looking for Issues] --> B{Program Target?}
    B -->|GSoC| C[GSoC Organizations List]
    B -->|LFX| D[LFX Mentorship Portal]
    B -->|Outreachy| E[Outreachy Projects]
    B -->|General| F[GitHub Search]
    
    C --> G[Find org → Check issues]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

## Evaluating Issue Quality

### ✅ Green Flags (Good Signs)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Good Issue] --> B[Clear description]
    A --> C[Recent activity]
    A --> D[Maintainer engagement]
    A --> E[Reproduction steps]
    A --> F[Defined scope]
```

**Look for:**

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Clear description | Maintainer thought about it |
| Recent comments | Issue is still relevant |
| Maintainer responded | Someone cares about this |
| Labels are appropriate | Project is organized |
| Acceptance criteria | You know when you're done |
| Referenced in roadmap | Important to the project |

### ❌ Red Flags (Warning Signs)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Bad Issue] --> B[Old with no activity]
    A --> C[Vague description]
    A --> D[Many failed attempts]
    A --> E[Controversial comments]
    A --> F[Stale label]
```

**Avoid:**

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| No activity for 6+ months | Likely abandoned |
| "Stale" or "wontfix" labels | Not a priority |
| Many attempted PRs, all closed | Unclear requirements |
| Heated discussions | Politics involved |
| Vague like "improve performance" | No clear direction |
| Assigned but inactive | Someone else has it |

## Issue Quality Assessment

### Quick Score Method

Rate each factor 1-5:

```
Issue Score = 
    Clarity (1-5) + 
    Recency (1-5) + 
    Maintainer Engagement (1-5) + 
    Scope Appropriateness (1-5) + 
    Learning Value (1-5)

Score > 20: Excellent issue
Score 15-20: Good issue
Score 10-15: Proceed with caution
Score < 10: Look elsewhere
```

### Example Evaluation

**Issue: "Fix broken pagination on user list"**

| Factor | Score | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Clarity | 4 | Clear what's broken |
| Recency | 5 | Opened 2 days ago |
| Maintainer | 5 | Maintainer commented "happy to help" |
| Scope | 4 | Well-defined, single component |
| Learning | 4 | Learn about pagination, API calls |
| **Total** | **22** | **Excellent issue!** |

## Fake "Good First Issues"

### Spotting Fake Ones

Some issues are labeled "good first issue" but aren't:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Good First Issue Label] --> B{Actually good?}
    B -->|Check| C[Requires deep domain knowledge?]
    B -->|Check| D[Spans multiple systems?]
    B -->|Check| E[Has unclear requirements?]
    B -->|Check| F[Needs architecture decisions?]
    
    C -->|Yes| G[❌ Not actually beginner-friendly]
    D -->|Yes| G
    E -->|Yes| G
    F -->|Yes| G
    
    C -->|No| H{All No?}
    D -->|No| H
    E -->|No| H
    F -->|No| H
    H -->|Yes| I[✅ Likely good first issue]
```

### Common Fake Patterns

**1. The Disguised Monster**
```
Title: "Simple UI fix"
Reality: Requires understanding entire state management system
```

**2. The Outdated Label**
```
Title: "Add basic feature" (labeled 2 years ago)
Reality: Codebase has completely changed
```

**3. The Scope Creep**
```
Title: "Fix small bug"
Comments: "Also need to refactor X, update Y, test Z..."
Reality: Not small anymore
```

**4. The Impossible Standard**
```
Title: "Improve performance"
Reality: No metrics, no baseline, how do you know when done?
```

## The Search Strategy

### Step 1: Choose Your Criteria

```bash
# Your filters
Language: JavaScript
Difficulty: Beginner
Time: 4-8 hours
Type: Bug fix or documentation
Project: Active (commits in last month)
```

### Step 2: GitHub Search

```
label:"good first issue" language:javascript created:>2024-01-01 comments:>2
```

### Step 3: Filter Results

For each result, check:
- [ ] Last commit to repo < 30 days
- [ ] Issue has maintainer comment
- [ ] Issue is unassigned
- [ ] Issue has clear requirements
- [ ] Project has CONTRIBUTING.md

### Step 4: Deep Dive on Top 3

For your top candidates:
1. Read entire issue thread
2. Check related code files
3. Look at similar merged PRs
4. Evaluate if you can solve it

## Issue Hunting Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Search] --> B[Apply Filters]
    B --> C[Review 10-15 Issues]
    C --> D{For Each Issue}
    D --> E[Read Description]
    E --> F{Understand it?}
    F -->|No| D
    F -->|Yes| G[Check Activity]
    G --> H{Active?}
    H -->|No| D
    H -->|Yes| I[Check Assignee]
    I --> J{Unassigned?}
    J -->|No| D
    J -->|Yes| K[Check Code]
    K --> L{Can Solve?}
    L -->|No| D
    L -->|Yes| M[Add to Shortlist]
    M --> N{Have 3 options?}
    N -->|No| D
    N -->|Yes| O[Pick Best One]
    O --> P[Claim Issue]
```

# See what gets merged
# Check merged PRs from new contributors
# Understand the review process
```

### 4. Check the "Pulse"

On GitHub, check Insights → Pulse:
- Recent commits
- Open/closed issues ratio
- PR merge rate

> **Pro Tip:** The best issues aren't always labeled. Sometimes a recent bug report with maintainer interest is better than a stale "good first issue."
