# When to Pause or Pivot

Sometimes you need to take a step back.

## Signs You Should Pause

```
✓ You're learning well right now
✓ You're making progress
✓ But you're burned out
✓ Or life needs your attention
```

**Action**: Take 2-4 week break. Come back refreshed.

## Signs You Should Pivot

```
✓ You've contributed for months
✓ But something feels wrong
✓ Project culture doesn't fit
✓ Your goals misaligned
✓ Maintainers aren't supportive
```

**Action**: Find new project. Same you, better fit.

## Pause Strategy

```
Before pausing:
- Finish current PR
- Update issue status
- Leave notes for others
- Let community know

Message:
"Taking a 3-week break. Back early [date].
Feel free to assign to others in meantime."
```

## Pivot Strategy

```
What to do:
- Complete or close current work
- Document what you learned
- Say graceful goodbye
- Celebrate your contributions
- Move to new project

What NOT to do:
- Ghost the community
- Badmouth the project
- Delete your contributions
- Burn bridges
```

## The Real Talk

```
You're allowed to:
- Take breaks
- Change projects
- Reduce involvement
- Step away entirely

You don't owe:
- Your free time
- Your health
- Your mental wellbeing
- Your sacrifice
```
