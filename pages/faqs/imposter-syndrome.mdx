# Handling Imposter Syndrome

You're not alone. Everyone feels this way.

## What Imposter Syndrome Looks Like

```
Thoughts:
"They'll find out I'm not as good as they think"
"I just got lucky"
"Next PR will reveal I'm a fraud"
"I don't deserve my success"

Reality:
"You're skilled and grew because of hard work"
"You earned every acceptance"
"Your PRs prove your ability"
"You absolutely deserve to be here"
```

## Quick Reality Checks

When doubt hits:

1. **Look at your PRs**
   - They were merged
   - Code review passed
   - Tests pass
   - You did that

2. **Read comments praising your work**
   - Save kind comments
   - Review them when doubting

3. **Remember your journey**
   - You were clueless 6 months ago
   - You learned
   - You shipped code
   - You have proof

## Managing the Syndrome

```
❌ Trying to be perfect
✅ Accepting "good enough" is excellent

❌ Never speaking up
✅ Sharing your ideas

❌ Comparing yourself to others
✅ Comparing yourself to past you

❌ Dismissing your achievements
✅ Celebrating your growth
```

## When It Gets Severe

If imposter syndrome is affecting mental health:
- Talk to mentor or friend
- Consider therapy
- Take a break if needed
- Remember: many successful people feel this
