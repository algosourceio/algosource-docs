# Not Feeling Good Enough

The most common feeling among new contributors.

## The Feeling

```
"I'm not smart enough"
"My code isn't good enough"
"Everyone else is better"
"I don't belong here"
```

## The Reality

```
The people who started were also beginners.
Everyone felt this way once.
Your feelings are normal.
Your feelings aren't facts.
```

## Evidence Check

```
Feeling: "My code is terrible"
Evidence: "I've shipped 3 merged PRs"
Reality: "If code was terrible, it wouldn't merge"

Feeling: "Everyone is smarter than me"
Evidence: "I understand core system X"
Reality: "You're smarter than you think"
```

## What Helps

```
✓ Remember you started somewhere
✓ Look at your first PR vs recent PR
✓ Ask for code review feedback
✓ See others struggling too
✓ Celebrate small wins
✓ Talk to mentors
```

## The Truth

```
Junior → Intermediate takes 6-12 months
Intermediate → Advanced takes 1-2 years
You're not behind.
You're exactly where you should be.
```
