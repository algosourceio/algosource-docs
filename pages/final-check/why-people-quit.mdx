# Why Most People Quit

Understanding failure modes helps you avoid them.

## Reason #1: Harsh Community

```
"I asked a question and got mocked"
"Maintainer was dismissive"
"Nobody helped me get started"
"I didn't feel welcome"
```

**Prevention**: Evaluate community before committing.

## Reason #2: Unrealistic Expectations

```
"I thought I'd ship features in 1 week"
"Turns out I don't understand the codebase"
"Turns out there's politics I didn't expect"
"I expected immediate feedback"
```

**Prevention**: Start small. Manage expectations.

## Reason #3: Wrong Project

```
"I thought I'd love this tech"
"But the codebase is a mess"
"Maintainers are hard to reach"
"The project direction bores me"
```

**Prevention**: Contribute before fully committing.

## Reason #4: No Support

```
"I got lost and nobody helped"
"No documentation for setup"
"Questions went unanswered"
"I gave up"
```

**Prevention**: Pick projects with good communities.

## Reason #5: Burnout

```
"I worked too much"
"Never felt I could say no"
"Pressure to keep going"
"Got exhausted and quit"
```

**Prevention**: Set boundaries from day one.

## Reason #6: Life Happened

```
"Job got busier"
"School ramped up"
"Personal issues came up"
"Had to step back"
```

**Prevention**: It's okay. Come back when you can.

- [ ] Contributed to 2-3 projects before choosing
