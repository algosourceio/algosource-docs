# Season of Bugs (SOB)

Security research meets open source. Find vulnerabilities, get recognized.

## Program Overview

Season of Bugs focuses on security testing, vulnerability discovery, and security improvements in open source projects.

<Cards>
<Card title="Focus" href="#">
Security audits, vulnerability discovery, security tooling
</Card>

<Card title="Rewards" href="#">
Varies by severity: $100-$5,000+ for critical vulnerabilities
</Card>

<Card title="Duration" href="#">
Typically 3-4 months, project-dependent
</Card>

<Card title="Skills Needed" href="#">
Security testing, code review, exploit development
</Card>
</Cards>

## Required Skills

### Technical Foundation

1. **Programming Languages**
   - C/C++ for low-level vulnerabilities
   - Python for security tooling
   - JavaScript for web security
   - Assembly for exploit development

2. **Security Knowledge**
   - Common vulnerability types (OWASP Top 10)
   - Exploitation techniques
   - Secure coding practices
   - Cryptography basics

3. **Tools**
   - Static analyzers (Coverity, SonarQube)
   - Dynamic testing (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer)
   - Fuzzers (AFL, libFuzzer)
   - Network tools (Wireshark, Burp Suite)

## Vulnerability Classification

| Severity | Bounty Range | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Critical** | $2,000-$5,000+ | Remote code execution, auth bypass |
| **High** | $1,000-$2,000 | SQL injection, XSS with major impact |
| **Medium** | $500-$1,000 | CSRF, info disclosure |
| **Low** | $100-$500 | Minor info leak, config issues |

## Reporting Process

<Steps>

### Discover Vulnerability
- Use fuzzing, code review, or dynamic testing
- Confirm reproducibility
- Assess impact and scope

### Write Detailed Report
- Clear description of vulnerability
- Step-by-step reproduction
- Proof-of-concept code/exploit
- Suggested fix

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report privately to security team
- Give time to patch (90 days standard)
- Don't publicize until fix is released

### Follow Up
- Answer questions from maintainers
- Test proposed patches
- Help with CVE assignment

</Steps>

## Sample Vulnerability Report Template

```markdown
## Summary
Brief one-line description of the vulnerability

## Severity
[Critical/High/Medium/Low] + CVSS score if calculated

## Affected Components
- Package: [name and version]
- File: [filename]
- Function: [function name]
- Line: [line number]

## Vulnerability Details
Detailed technical explanation of the issue

## Reproduction Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Expected: [what should happen]
4. Actual: [what actually happens]

## Proof of Concept
```code
[PoC exploit code]
```

## Impact Assessment
- Who is affected
- What can attacker achieve
- Likelihood of exploitation

## Suggested Fix
Technical recommendations for patching

## Timeline
- Discovered: [date]
- Reported: [date]
- Acknowledged: [date]
- Expected Fix: [date]
```

## Common Vulnerability Types to Look For

<Cards>
<Card title="Memory Safety" href="#">
Buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-free in C/C++ code
</Card>

<Card title="Injection Attacks" href="#">

```

## Ethics & Legal

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Critical: Legal Boundaries**


**Always:**
- Get written permission before testing
- Test only in scope systems
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Don't access/modify production data

**Never:**
- Test production systems without permission
- Publicize vulnerabilities before patches
- Use found vulnerabilities maliciously
- Share exploits publicly before fixes
