## Special Considerations for GovTech

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Different from Commercial Tech**


**Government projects require:**
- **Security First**: Handling sensitive citizen data
- **Accessibility**: Support for multiple languages, low bandwidth
- **Documentation**: Clear guides for government officials
- **Compliance**: Following government IT policies and standards
- **Scale**: Millions of users, not thousands

</Callout>
