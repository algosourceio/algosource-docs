## GSoC Reality Check

```
What students think:
"I'll get accepted first try, work on cool features,
and get a job offer immediately after"

What actually happens:
"I apply, get rejected. Reapply next year.
Get accepted. Work hard for 22 weeks.
Learn tons. Maybe get a job, maybe not.
But I'm now a known contributor."

Timeline reality:
Year 0: Learn and contribute (3-6 months prep)
Year 1: Apply and likely get rejected
Year 2: Get accepted
Year 2-3: Post-GSoC work and career benefits
```

## Common Mistakes

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Proposal Killers**


### ❌ **Generic Proposals**
```
"I will implement the feature as described in the ideas page."
```
✅ **Instead**: Show you understand the problem deeply and have thought through implementation.

### ❌ **Unrealistic Timelines**
```
Week 1-2: Build entire backend
Week 3: Build entire frontend
Week 4: Deploy to production
```
✅ **Instead**: Break into small, testable milestones with buffer time.

### ❌ **Zero Prior Contributions**
```
"I'm very interested in this project and quick learner."
```
✅ **Instead**: Have 2-3 merged PRs before application deadline.
