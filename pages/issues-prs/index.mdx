# Issues & Pull Requests

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
**The Core Workflow**

Issues and PRs are the primary communication mechanisms in open source. Master them, and you master open source contribution.
</Callout>

## The Complete Cycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Spot Problem] --> B[Search Existing Issues]
    B --> C{Already Reported?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Comment/Subscribe]
    C -->|No| E[Create Issue]
    E --> F{Got Assignment?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Fork & Branch]
    F -->|No| H[Wait for Feedback]
    H --> G
    G --> I[Write Code]
    I --> J[Create PR]
    J --> K[Code Review]
    K --> L{Approved?}
    L -->|No| M[Address Feedback]
    M --> K
    L -->|Yes| N[Merged! 🎉]
```

## The Two Pillars

<Cards>
<Card title="Issues" href="/issues-prs/raising-issues">
**Communication tool** for problems, features, and questions. Good issues get triage fast; bad ones get closed or ignored.
</Card>

<Card title="Pull Requests" href="/issues-prs/writing-prs">
**Code delivery mechanism**. Small, focused PRs with tests and good descriptions get merged. Large, unclear PRs die in review.
</Card>
</Cards>

## Common Mistakes

### Issue Mistakes

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**These Get Issues Closed Without Action**

- "It doesn't work" (no details)
- Asking for ETAs or demanding fixes
- Not checking if already reported
- Missing reproduction steps
- Opening issues that belong in discussions
</Callout>

### PR Mistakes

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**These Get PRs Ignored or Rejected**

- No description or "small fix" without context
- Massive diffs touching unrelated files
- No tests when tests are expected
- Ignoring CI failures
- Being defensive about feedback
</Callout>

## Time Expectations

```mermaid
gantt
    title Typical Issue→PR→Merge Timeline
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Issue Phase
    Issue opened           :2024-01-01, 1d
    Maintainer responds    :2024-01-02, 2d
    Assignment             :2024-01-03, 1d
    section Development
    Local development      :2024-01-04, 4d
    Testing               :2024-01-07, 1d
    section PR Phase
    PR opened             :2024-01-08, 1d
    First review          :2024-01-10, 2d
    Address feedback      :2024-01-12, 2d
    Second review         :2024-01-14, 2d
    Merge                 :2024-01-16, 1d
```

**Reality check:**
- First response to issue: 1-3 days (sometimes 1-2 weeks)
- First PR review: 2-7 days (sometimes longer)
- Total time to merge first PR: 2-6 weeks average

## The Mindset Shift

### ❌ Wrong Mindset

```
"I'll open an issue and get an immediate response"
"My PR is perfect, reviewers are nitpicking"
"I'll make one huge PR with all my changes"
"If my PR doesn't merge, the maintainers are biased"
```

### ✅ Right Mindset

```
"I'll provide all the info maintainers need upfront"
"Reviews improve my code and teach me conventions"
"I'll make small PRs that are easy to review"
"If my PR doesn't merge, I'll learn why and improve"
```
