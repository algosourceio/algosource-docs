# Debugging Techniques

Debugging is a skill. Get good at it.

## The Debugging Process

```
1. Reproduce
   ↓ Can you make it happen consistently?
   
2. Isolate
   ↓ What's the minimal case that breaks?
   
3. Hypothesis
   ↓ What do you think is wrong?
   
4. Test
   ↓ Check if your hypothesis is correct
   
5. Fix
   ↓ Implement the solution
   
6. Verify
   ↓ Confirm the bug is gone
```

## Advanced Debugging Strategies

### 1. Read Error Messages (Carefully, Twice)

```
❌ BAD DEBUGGING:
Error: "TypeError on line 42"
*changes random code*

✓ GOOD DEBUGGING:
Error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined"
Line 42: user.profile.name
Questions:
- What is user? (defined? not null?)
- What is user.profile? (exists? not undefined?)

Then trace back: where does user come from?
```

### 2. Isolate the Problem

```
SCENARIO: Login form broken, 5 different fields

Bad approach:
- Spend 3 hours debugging entire flow
- Still confused

Good approach:
1. Isolate: Test each field separately
2. Find: "Email field works, password fails"
3. Isolate more: "Password validation breaks"
4. Find: "Regex pattern is wrong"
5. Fix: 2-minute change

Time: 30 minutes instead of 3 hours
```

### 3. Use Different Tools for Different Cases

| Situation | Tool | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **"I don't know what's happening"** | Debugger + breakpoints | Step through line by line |
| **"Performance is slow"** | Profiler | See which functions take time |
| **"Something changed and broke"** | Git bisect | Find the exact commit |
| **"Tests fail inconsistently"** | Logging + timestamps | Find race conditions |
| **"CI fails but local works"** | Docker + CI commands | Recreate exact environment |

## Real-World Debugging Example

### The Scenario
```
Bug: User avatars not loading on profile page
Status: Works in staging, broken in production
Team: "Must be a caching issue"

What's actually happening:
- Staging: Uses internal CDN URL
- Production: Uses external CDN URL
- External CDN: Requires CORS header
- Response: Missing CORS header = images blocked

Debugging path:
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Click broken image → see 403 error
3. Check request headers
4. See CORS error in console
5. Find: Missing CORS header in production config
6. Fix: Add CORS header to production
```

### Bad vs Good Debugging

```
❌ TEAM A (Bad):
"It's probably a cache issue"
→ Clears cache (doesn't help)
→ Spends 4 hours investigating
→ Finally looks at actual error
→ Solves in 10 minutes

✓ TEAM B (Good):
1. Looks at actual error first (DevTools)
2. Sees 403 CORS error
3. Checks config files
4. Finds missing header
5. Solves in 20 minutes (including testing)
```

## Debugging Tools Quick Reference

<Cards>
<Card title="VSCode Debugger" href="#">
Set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables. Works for Node.js, Python, more.
</Card>

<Card title="Browser DevTools" href="#">
Network tab (see requests), Console (see errors), Sources (debug JS), Application (see storage)
</Card>

<Card title="Git Bisect" href="#">
Find which commit broke something: `git bisect start` then test commits
</Card>

<Card title="Logging" href="#">
Add structured logs with timestamps to trace execution flow in production
</Card>

<Card title="Profiling" href="#">
Find performance bottlenecks: which functions are slow?
</Card>

<Card title="Strace/Ltrace" href="#">
Advanced: See system calls being made by your program

## Common Debugging Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Better Approach |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Change code randomly** | Wastes hours, introduces new bugs | Understand root cause first |
| **Assume you know the problem** | You're usually wrong | Test your assumptions |
| **Debug without tools** | Slower, miss details | Use debugger or logs |
| **Ignore error messages** | Most info is in the error | Read them carefully |
| **Don't isolate the problem** | Debugging entire app is hard | Find the minimal failing case |

> **Good debugging isn't luck.** It's a process. Follow the process, find the bug.
