# Understanding CI Failures

CI failures aren't mysterious. Learn to read them.

## Common CI Jobs

```
✓ Tests
✓ Linting
✓ Type Checking
✓ Coverage
✓ Performance Benchmarks
✓ Security Scanning
```

## Reading Failure Output

```
JOB: Tests
FAILURE: Test 'get_user_by_id' failed

AssertionError: None != <User object>
File: tests/test_user_service.py:45
    assert result == expected_user

The test expected result to be a User object,
but got None instead.
```

**What to do**: Fix the code to return a User object.

## Common Failures

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Test failed** | Code broke expected behavior | Fix the code |
| **Import error** | Missing/wrong module | Check imports |
| **Type error** | Wrong data type | Fix types |
| **Coverage dropped** | Tests don't cover new code | Add tests |
| **Lint failed** | Code style violated | Run formatter |

## Debugging CI

```
1. Read the exact error
2. Reproduce locally
3. Fix locally
4. Run tests locally
5. Push again
6. Watch CI pass
```
