# Linters, Formatters & CI

Automated quality checks catch errors before humans do.

# Linters, Formatters & CI

Learn these tools. They make your life easier and your code better.

## The Purpose of Each Tool

```
LINTER (Find bugs):
x = 5
if x = 5:  ❌ Error! = is assignment, == is comparison
    pass

FORMATTER (Make it consistent):
Before: x=1+2
After:  x = 1 + 2

CI Pipeline (Automated verification):
Step 1: Run tests
Step 2: Run linters
Step 3: Check coverage
Step 4: Report results → Approve or block PR
```

## Setting Up Linters Locally

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```bash
# Install ESLint
npm install --save-dev eslint

# Create config
npx eslint --init

# Run on your code
npx eslint src/

# Fix automatically where possible
npx eslint src/ --fix
```

### Python

```bash
# Install pylint or flake8
pip install pylint

# Run on your code
pylint src/

# Or use autopep8 to auto-fix
pip install autopep8
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive src/file.py
```

## Setting Up Formatters

### JavaScript (Prettier)

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier

# Format code
npx prettier --write src/

# Check before commit
npx prettier --check src/
```

### Python (Black)

```bash
pip install black

# Format code
black src/

# Check before commit
black --check src/
```

## Pre-Commit Hooks (Game Changer)

Automatically run checks before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << EOF
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
EOF

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install

# Now on every commit, checks run automatically
git commit -m "Fix bug"
# → Black runs
# → If fails, commit is blocked
# → Fix it, try again
```

## Understanding CI Failures

### Scenario: Your PR CI fails

```
Step 1: Look at CI logs
GitHub → Your PR → "Checks" tab → Click failing job

Step 2: Read the error carefully
Example:
  Error: Test suite failed
  FAIL src/auth.test.js
  ✕ should validate email format
  Expected: true
  Received: false

Step 3: Reproduce locally
npm test -- src/auth.test.js

Step 4: Fix it
(Based on the test failure, update code)

Step 5: Push fix
git add . && git commit -m "Fix email validation" && git push

Step 6: Watch CI pass
(Go back to PR checks → See green checkmark)
```

### Common CI Failures and Fixes

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Test failed** | Code has bug | Debug test, fix code |
| **Linting error** | Code style wrong | Run `prettier --write .` or `eslint --fix .` |
| **Type error** | TypeScript issue | Fix type annotations or cast properly |
| **Coverage dropped** | Not enough tests | Write tests for new code |
| **Import error** | Missing dependency | `npm install` or `pip install` |

## CI Pipeline Checklist (Before Pushing)

```
Before git push, run locally:

□ npm test (or pytest)
  If fails: Fix code and test again
  
□ npm run lint (or pylint)
  If fails: Run npm run lint --fix
  
□ npm run format (or black)
  If fails: Already fixed, just commit
  
□ Code review guidelines
  - Is code readable?
  - Are there comments where needed?
  - Did I handle edge cases?

All green? → git push
```

## Reading a Successful CI Report

```
✓ All checks passed

Breakdown:
✓ Test Suite - 142 passed in 3.2s
✓ Linting - 0 errors, 0 warnings
✓ Coverage - 82% (threshold: 75%)
✓ Type Check - 0 errors

This PR is ready to merge.
Maintainer sees green lights → fast approval.
```

## Pro Tip: Use Formatters to Your Advantage

```
❌ Bad workflow:
1. Write code
2. Style it manually (tedious)
3. Push
4. CI complains about formatting

✓ Good workflow:
1. Write code (messy is fine)
2. Run prettier/black (automatic formatting)
3. Push
4. CI approves immediately (no formatting issues)

You save 10-15 minutes per PR just by using formatters.
```
