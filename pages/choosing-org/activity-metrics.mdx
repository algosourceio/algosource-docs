# Activity Metrics That Matter

Use data to evaluate project health.

## Key Metrics

### Commit Frequency

```
Healthy: >= 5 commits/week
Concerning: 1-5 commits/week
Unhealthy: < 1 commit/month
```

### Issue Resolution

| Metric | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|
| Time to close issue | < 2 weeks | > 3 months |
| Issue response time | < 2 days | > 1 week |
| Open vs closed ratio | 1:5 | 1:1 or worse |

### PR Metrics

```
Good PR Project:
- Merged PRs within 2 weeks
- Code review feedback constructive
- Tests required before merge
- Clear labeling and milestones

Bad PR Project:
- PRs sit unreviewed for months
- Hostile review feedback
- No tests required
- No organization
```

### Release Frequency

```
Healthy: Regular releases (monthly/quarterly)
Stalled: No release in 6+ months
Dead: No release in 1+ year
```

## Tools for Analysis

- **GitHub Insights**: Pulse, Contributors, Traffic
- **OpenHub**: Project statistics and history
- **GrimoireLab**: Deep analytics on development
- **DevStats**: Kubernetes-style community metrics

## Interpreting the Data

```
High Activity + Responsive Maintainers
= Healthy Project

High Activity + Unresponsive Maintainers
= Risky (might be chaotic)

Low Activity + Responsive Maintainers
= Stable/Mature (less drama)

Low Activity + Unresponsive Maintainers
= AVOID
```

## Questions to Ask Data

1. Is the project growing or shrinking?
2. Are contributors new or same people?
3. Is maintenance reactive or proactive?
4. What's the dependency update frequency?
5. How often are security patches released?
