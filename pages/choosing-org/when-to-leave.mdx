# When to Leave an Organization

It's okay to outgrow or move on from a project.

## Valid Reasons to Leave

### 1. Project is Unhealthy

- Toxic maintainers
- Hostile community
- Unresponsive to issues
- No clear direction

### 2. You've Learned What You Came For

```
I joined to learn:
✓ Django internals → I understand them
✓ How open source works → I get it
✓ Contributing to major project → Done

Now it's time to move on to next challenge.
```

### 3. Project Direction Changed

- Went corporate
- Stopped being beginner-friendly
- Now requires deep expertise you don't have
- Technology shifted away from your interests

### 4. You've Become More Skilled

Time to:
- Take ownership of harder issues
- Move to a more complex project
- Lead in an area that interests you
- Start your own project

### 5. Project is Dying

Signs:
- Maintenance in life support mode
- No energy for new features
- Community scattered
- Unclear future

## How to Leave Well

<Steps>

### Finish Outstanding Work
Complete or wrap up PRs you've started.

### Write a Closing Message
```markdown
Closing my involvement with [Project] because [reason].

Thank you for:
- Teaching me [skill]
- Connecting me with [community]
- Supporting my growth

I'll stay involved with [specific area if applicable].
```

### Update Your Portfolio
- Highlight your contributions
- Write a blog post about learnings
- Document what you built

### Maintain Gracefully
- Don't publicly criticize
- Don't burn bridges
- Leave the community better than you found it

</Steps>

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Disappear without notice
- ❌ Leave passive-aggressive comments
- ❌ Badmouth the project publicly
- ❌ Delete your contributions
- ❌ Recruit others away from it

## Transition to New Project

You're more valuable now:

```
Before: "I'm new and learning"
After: "I've shipped features in real projects"

Before: "I don't know anything"
After: "I understand open source workflows"

Before: "Help me get started"
After: "I can help others get started"
```

## Staying Connected

You can:
- Follow the project casually
- Help review PRs occasionally
- Mentor new contributors
- Contribute security patches
- Stay in community channels

## When You Leave Early

If leaving before making major impact:

- Don't feel guilty
- Your learning has value
- You gave it a fair shot
- Share what you learned
