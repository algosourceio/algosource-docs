## Checking Availability

### GitHub Metrics

- Last commit date
- Response time on recent issues
- PR merge velocity
- Issue closure rate

### Community Channels

- Join Discord/Slack
- Ask a test question
- Observe response patterns
- Note timezone considerations

## Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| No commits for 6+ months | Project is abandoned |
| Issues marked WONTFIX without reason | Maintainer lost interest |
| Comments only on old issues | Activity is sporadic |
| No maintainer responses | You won't get support |

## Time Zone Reality

```
Scenario: You're in India, project maintainer in California

Good: Maintainer responds within 24-48 hours
Bad: Maintainer only responds during their business hours
Ugly: Maintainer is sleeping when you need help
```

## What to Expect

- **Professional Projects**: Response within 1-2 days
- **Community Projects**: Response within 3-5 days
- **Hobby Projects**: Response within 1-2 weeks

## If Maintainer is Unavailable

- Check if there are other maintainers
- Look for active contributors
- Consider if project is stable enough for you
- Understand you may be on your own
