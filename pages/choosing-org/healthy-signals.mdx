# Signals of a Healthy Organization

Not all open source projects are equal. Learn to spot healthy communities.

## How to Actually Evaluate a Project (Step by Step)

**Time investment: 15-30 minutes per project**

### Step 1: Check Recent Activity (5 minutes)

```
Go to GitHub project → Insights tab

Look for:
- When was last commit? (should be < 1 month)
- How many commits per week? (should be 2+)
- Are there recent issues? (< 1 week old)
- Are PRs being merged? (not sitting stale)

Good sign: "Last commit 3 days ago, 8 commits this week"
Bad sign: "Last commit 6 months ago, no activity"
```

### Step 2: Check Maintainer Responsiveness (5 minutes)

```
Pick a recent issue (< 2 weeks old)

Measure:
- Time until first response? (< 3 days = good)
- Is feedback constructive? (helpful, specific)
- Do they respond to follow-ups? (engaged)

Method: Look at issue, click "Show timeline"
See: "opened 5 days ago, commented 4 days ago"

If pattern across 3 issues is:
✓ < 3 days response = healthy
⚠️ 1-2 weeks response = slow
❌ > 2 weeks = unresponsive
```

### Step 3: Check Community Size (5 minutes)

```
Navigate to:
- GitHub → Stars (commits followers)
- GitHub → Contributors
- GitHub → Forks
- Issues → Open count

Numbers that matter:
100-500 stars = Small community (easier to be known)
500-2000 stars = Medium community (good balance)
2000+ stars = Large community (harder to stand out)

Open issues:
< 50 = Well-maintained
50-200 = Healthy (some work needed)
> 200 = Understaffed
> 500 = Likely abandoned
```

### Step 4: Check Code Review Quality (10 minutes)

```
Find a merged PR from last month
Open it → Look at review comments

Score each comment:

✓ GOOD: "This will break X. Let's handle it like the code does in Y file"
  → Specific, educational, constructive
  
✓ GOOD: "Can you add tests for this edge case?"
  → Clear requirement, shows they care about quality
  
❌ BAD: "This is wrong" (no explanation)
  → Dismissive, not helpful
  
❌ BAD: "Just approve, we'll fix later" (in all reviews)
  → Quality doesn't matter to them
  
Sample 3-5 merged PRs:
- If mostly good → healthy community
- If mostly bad → toxic gatekeeping
```

## Red Flags (Quick Checklist)

| Flag | Evidence | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| **Unresponsive** | > 2 weeks to reply to issues | Your PRs will sit forever |
| **Single maintainer** | Only 1 person with commits | Project dies if they quit |
| **Abandoned** | No commits in 6+ months | Fork it or move on |
| **Toxic** | Dismissive tone, arguments | Mentally draining |
| **No tests** | 0 test files or very few | Code breaks easily |
| **No docs** | No CONTRIBUTING.md | Can't figure out how to help |
| **Low activity** | < 1 commit per month | Not going anywhere |

## Green Flags (Checklist)

| Flag | Evidence | Benefit |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Multiple maintainers** | 3+ people commit regularly | Sustainable |
| **Active discussions** | Issues/PRs have thoughtful comments | Engaged community |
| **Good documentation** | README + CONTRIBUTING + architecture | Easy onboarding |
| **New contributor issues** | "good-first-issue" label exists | They welcome beginners |
| **Fast merging** | PRs merged within 2 weeks | You get feedback quickly |
| **Community spaces** | Discord/Slack actively used | You can ask questions |
| **Regular releases** | Versions published monthly | Project is moving forward |

> **Spend 30 minutes evaluating before 3 months contributing.**
- Massive PRs reviewed rarely
- Security vulnerabilities ignored

### 🚩 Unhealthy Dynamics

- "Real developers" gatekeeping attitude
- Dismissal of non-code contributions
- Harassment or discrimination
- Retaliation against critics

## Evaluation Checklist

<Steps>

<Step>**Check GitHub Activity**
- Visit recent commits tab
- Browse recent issues and PRs
- Check pull request approval time


<Step>**Read Documentation**
- Does README make sense?
- Is CONTRIBUTING.md clear?
- Are there setup guides?


<Step>**Browse Recent Issues**
- How do maintainers respond?
- Are questions answered?
- What's the tone of discussions?


<Step>**Test Local Setup**
- Follow setup instructions
- Note any issues or gaps
- Check if dev community is responsive


<Step>**Join Community Channels**
- Introduce yourself
- Ask a question
- Notice how people respond


</Steps>

## Questions to Ask

- "What's the typical review time for PRs?"
- "How do you welcome new contributors?"
- "What's your policy on inactive maintainers?"
- "How do you handle disagreements?"

## How to Leave Gracefully

If you discover a project is unhealthy:

1. Don't burn bridges
2. Leave a constructive comment
3. Recommend it to others with caveats
4. Find a healthier project instead

Remember: Your time and energy matter.
