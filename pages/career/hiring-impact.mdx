# How Open Source Impacts Hiring

Understanding what employers see changes how you contribute.

## What Employers See

```
If you contribute to [Company X]'s open source project:
↓
"This person understands our architecture"
"They can onboard quickly"
"They've worked with our stack"
"They're genuinely interested in us"
```

## Red Flags Employers Notice

```
✗ Contributions only to resume projects
✗ PR that was immediately rejected
✗ Abandonment mid-project
✗ Low-quality code
✗ No collaboration
```

## Green Flags

```
✓ Long-term contributions (1+ years)
✓ Multiple merged PRs
✓ High quality code
✓ Community respect
✓ Mentor to new contributors
```

## The Hiring Conversation

Recruiter sees your GitHub:

```
"I see you contributed to [Project]. Tell me about it."

Bad answer: "I just fixed some bugs"
Good answer: "I helped optimize the caching layer, 
which reduced latency by 40%. The experience taught 
me about [specific technical skill]."
```

## Impact on Offers

```
Standard offer: $100k + benefits
Your open source work: Known for quality
Adjusted offer: $120k + benefits + remote

Because they know your skills are proven.
