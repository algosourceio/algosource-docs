## Common Mistakes at This Stage

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Don't Skip Ahead**

The biggest mistake is jumping straight to coding without proper setup and research.
</Callout>

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Jumping to code immediately | No context, likely rejected | Read all docs first |
| Ignoring skill assessment | Choosing projects too advanced | Be honest about abilities |
| Not setting up Git properly | Embarrassing commit issues | Configure git globally |
| Skipping project research | Ending up in toxic/dead projects | Spend a week researching |
| Starting with huge projects | Overwhelming, slow reviews | Start with medium-sized |

---

## Success Metrics

By the end of this section, you should be able to answer YES to all of these:


- [ ] I know my current skill level and have chosen projects accordingly
- [ ] My dev environment is fully configured (Git, IDE, languages)
- [ ] My GitHub profile is professional and complete
- [ ] I have 2-3 projects identified that I want to contribute to
- [ ] I have read all relevant documentation for my target project
- [ ] I can clone, build, and run my target project locally
- [ ] I understand the project's code structure at a high level
- [ ] I have found at least 2-3 potential issues to work on


---

## Time Investment

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Skills Assessment | 30 min |
| Dev Environment Setup | 1-2 hours |
| GitHub Profile | 30 min |
| Finding Projects | 2-3 hours |
| Reading Documentation | 1-2 hours |
| Local Setup | 1-3 hours |
| Understanding Codebase | 2-4 hours |
| Choosing Issues | 1-2 hours |
| **Total** | **9-17 hours** |

<Callout type="tip" emoji="💡">
**Spread It Out**

Don't try to do all this in one day. Spread it over 2-3 weeks for better retention and less burnout.
