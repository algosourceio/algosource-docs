## Good First Issue Labels

Different projects use different labels:

| Label | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| `good first issue` | GitHub's official label for beginners |
| `first-timers-only` | Reserved specifically for first-time contributors |
| `beginner` / `beginner-friendly` | Suitable for beginners |
| `help wanted` | Maintainers need help (may not be beginner) |
| `easy` / `low-hanging-fruit` | Relatively simple to implement |
| `documentation` | Doc improvements (often good for first-timers) |
| `starter issue` | Another beginner-friendly variant |

---

## Finding Issues

### GitHub Search Queries

```bash
# Good first issues in a specific repo
repo:facebook/react label:"good first issue" is:open

# Help wanted, not assigned
repo:vercel/next.js label:"help wanted" no:assignee is:open

# Documentation issues
repo:microsoft/vscode label:"documentation" is:open

# Issues without PRs linked
repo:org/project label:"good first issue" is:open linked:pr is:unlinked
```

### Project-Specific Locations

<Steps>

### Check Issues tab

Go to `github.com/org/project/issues` and filter by labels.



### Check Contributing Guide

Some projects list beginner issues in their CONTRIBUTING.md.



### Check project roadmap

Projects sometimes tag issues for upcoming releases that need help.



### Check community channels

Discord/Slack often has channels specifically for finding issues.

## Before Claiming an Issue

<Steps>

### Read the entire thread

Read ALL comments. Someone might have already solved it, or there might be important context.



### Check for linked PRs

Look in the sidebar for "Linked pull requests". If there's an open PR, the issue is taken.



### Check recent comments

Look for "I'm working on this" or "@maintainer can I take this?"



### Understand the scope

Make sure you understand:
- What exactly needs to be done
- Where the code lives
- How to test the fix



### Comment to claim

Leave a comment expressing interest:
```
Hi! I'd like to work on this issue. I've read through the discussion and 
I understand the requirements. I plan to [brief approach]. 
Could you assign this to me?
```



### Wait for response

Don't start coding until a maintainer acknowledges you. They might have additional context or want to assign it officially.

</Steps>

## Sample First Issues by Type

### Documentation Issue

```markdown
Title: Clarify installation instructions for Windows users

Labels: good first issue, documentation

Description:
The current README says "run npm install" but Windows users have 
reported issues with native dependencies. 

Task:
- Add Windows-specific instructions
- Include required Visual Studio Build Tools setup
- Test on a Windows machine if possible
```

**Why it's good:** Clear scope, no code changes, helps real users.

### Bug Fix Issue

```markdown
Title: Button click handler fires twice on mobile

Labels: good first issue, bug

Description:
On mobile devices, clicking the submit button fires the 
handler twice. This causes duplicate form submissions.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open app on mobile Safari
2. Fill out form
3. Tap submit button
4. Observe network tab shows two requests

Expected: One request
Actual: Two requests

Hint: Look at src/components/Button.tsx, the touchend event 
might be the issue.
```

**Why it's good:** Clear reproduction, hints provided, self-contained.

### Test Issue

```markdown
Title: Add tests for UserService.updateProfile()

Labels: good first issue, testing

Description:
The updateProfile method in src/services/user.ts has no 
test coverage. Add tests for:
- Successful profile update
- Validation errors
- User not found case

Related file: src/services/user.test.ts (add tests here)
```

**Why it's good:** Clearly scoped, teaches the codebase, valuable contribution.
